# Writing Streak

https://writingstreak.io/

## Project's Purpose
Writing Streak is a tool that helps writers to:
- Develop a daily writing habit
- Increase their writing output
- Master the art of writing in a fun and engaging way

## Building a writing habit and increasing their output

Writing Steak helps writers to accomplish their goals by:

- Tracking their progress (like daily word counts and the amount of time they have spent focused on writing), and displaying the data in a beautiful way.
- Using gamification tools (like "writing sprints" or the "typewriter mode" you can learn about on the landing page).
- Using a goal-setting and tracking tool (a SCRUM-like burndown chart) that helps writers to set and achieve their word count goals.

## A publishing platform and a community
Writing Streak is also a reddit-like community and a publishing tool the writers can use to share their work and exchange feedback.

- Writers can create their stories using a beautiful rich-text WYSIWYG editor (built using TipTap).
- The published stories can be upvoted and ranked by "hotness" to introduce an element of competition (for further gamification).
- The posts have nested comments people can use to discuss the author's work and help them make improevments.
