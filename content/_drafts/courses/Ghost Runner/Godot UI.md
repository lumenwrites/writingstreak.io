## Godot UI

[https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/intro_to_the_editor_interface.html](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/intro_to_the_editor_interface.html)

## Project Manager
When you first open Godot, you'll see the project manager. Every game that you'll make in Godot is called a project, and this is the place where you create new projects or open existing ones.

### Creating a Project
Give your project a name, and create a folder. It has to be an empty folder.

Click the Browse button to open Godot's file browser and pick a location or type the folder's path in the Project Path field.

### Opening Existing Project
//Place the assets you've downloaded in the previous video into the [godot project path].

Click import.

Let's open it.

#### Scene Dock
The **Scene dock** lists the active scene's content.

#### File System Dock

The **FileSystem dock** is where you'll manage your project files and assets.

#### Inspector

The **Inspector** allows for the management of the properties of a scene's content.

#### Viewport

#### Toolbar

In the center, you have the **Toolbar** at the top, where you'll find tools to move, scale or lock your scene's objects.

#### Bottom Panel

The **Bottom Panel** is the host for the debug console, the animation editor.

#### Workspaces

At the very top you see list of workspaces. 2D workspace is for 2D games, 3D workspace is for 3D games, Script workspace is the code editor where you write your scripts, and AssetLib contains assets you can download.

In this series, we'll only ever use the 2D workspace to visually edit our game, and Script workspace to write the code.

#### Run Game Buttons

In the top-right are the buttons that allow you to run the game.
