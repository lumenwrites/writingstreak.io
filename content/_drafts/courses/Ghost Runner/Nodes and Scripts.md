# Nodes

Projects in godot are made out of scenes, and scenes are made out of nodes. Nodes are basic building blocks. They can be nested.

Running a game means running a scene. Project can have several scenes, multiple levels for example, but you need to select one main scene to start the game, for example first level.

Scenes can be instanced into scenes like any other node. Open player scene to see how it works. clapperboard icon

Link button to link a scene. Link a coin. For example, background is a node I've added from the list, it came with godot. Player is a scene I have created myself out of several other nodes.

So it's very powerful, you can build very complicated games out of very simple blocks.

-   When you click on a node, inspector shows you all of it's properties and parameters. Position, color, etc. That's how you edit things.
    
-   We will learn the rest as we go along.
    

# Scripts

Scenes can have scripts attached to them. Click on a script button to show it.

Godot supports multiple programming languages, but by default we'll be using gdscript. It is a lot like python, extremely simple to learn and to read, and super fun to use. You'll see that I won't even have to teach you the language itself, because after java you'll just pick it up immediately. If I'm wrong and anything is confusing, just let me know.
