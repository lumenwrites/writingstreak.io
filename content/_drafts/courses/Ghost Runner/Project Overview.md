# Project Overview

and Key Concepts

In this video, I will give you the overview of the final project we're going to create, and introduce you to Godot's UI and some Key Concepts. Don't worry about trying to understand everything you see on the screen, I will explain everything in more detail as we go along and build our game. This video is just an overview of things to come.


## Project overview

-   File structure. Organize things into folders. Scenes and script files. Enemies, Environment, Player, UI, Assets.
-   World is the main level, it contains all the objects we need for our game.
-   Tilemap allows you to draw walls, edit levels.
-   Portal spawns ghosts every few seconds. Ghost is a ghost. When player collides with him it's game over. When player collides with the gold, score increases. Hud contains the score. Music is music.
    
# Here's what we'll need to do:

-   Create a player that can run around as we press the buttons.
    
-   Create a ghost that can float around and bump into walls.
    
-   Create a portal that spawns new ghosts.
    
-   Create coins that player can pick up, and that will increse the score.
    
-   Create end game screen. I'll be happy if we can make the player and the ghosts today, then we'll see how much time and energy we have left. Creating a UI is traditionally the least fun part of making the game, so we can leave it for later.0
