I keep seeking a brilliant billion dollar startup idea, a clever hack that will make accomplishing my goals fast and easy than they're supposed to be.

But it's important to remember that it doesn't have to be that complicated


courses and saas
barbershop

tutorials dont have to be original

blog posts dont hafe to be amazing

just work on things and learn things, write what you think and learn
get good at what you do by practicing, doing obvious work that needs to get done.
clever ideas are a side effect of just being good at what  you do (or so I hope)
