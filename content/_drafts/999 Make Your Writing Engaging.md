# Make Writing Engaging
Some people (like Scott Alexander, Paul Graham, and David Wong) make their writing very easy and fun to read. Why are some articles so much more engaging than others?

Here are some things I have noticed.

Simple and clear language. They're not looking for fancy words to impress your with their vocabulary, they don't explain things in a convoluted or needlessly sophisticsted way to demonstrate how smart they are. Instead, they **choose words that convey ideas as simply and plainly as possible**. That makes them easy to read.

**Brevity** - they don't use more words than they have to, they have a high ideas per wordcount ratio.

Their writing is **insightful** - they talk about clever ideas I've never heard of before, they explain complicated concepts in simple and accessible ways. I feel like some of this genuinely makes me smarter (I hope), and some of it is just insight porn - they evoke a pleasant sensation of having learned something that gives me a little rush of dopamine.

Their writing is **useful**. It feels like youre learning something. EY and AR teach rationality, Tyler teaches social skills, Wong and SSC teach whatever insigtful ideas they're curious about and researched.

They're **funny**, they regularly use jokes or witty thurns of phrase. I feel like this is one of the most important factors in engaging writing, but I still don't know how to actually do this, I don't have a formula for making those up.

They write with **authority and conviction**. I think this is something anyone should be able to do - avoid countless disclaimers, **have strong opinions**, express them with conviction. It's much more interesting to read than the insecure authors constantly hedging their bets, and it's not at odds with being rational and open minded. Eliezer Yudkowsky, Ayn Rand, and Owen Cook are my favorite examples of speaking with conviction. they care deeply and passionately about something, see the world from a certain perspective, and unapologetically express it.

A cool trick I have learned by listening to Harmontown (a podcast by Dan Harmon, the author of Community and Rick and Morty) is that it *doesn't even matter* which opinion you have. Often Dan will just **pick a strong stance** and rant about something ridiculous, like some minor annoyance or a movie he disliked. This makes him almost automatically entertaining to listen to.

**Make abstract ideas concrete**, by using specific real-life examples, vivid metaphors, interesting thoughts experiment. Almost any article or a podcast discussing abstract ideas becomes instantly more entertaining when the authors try to list specific examples of a general idea.

Cause **emotional spikes** - both David Wong and Scott Alexander say things that feel like pushing a gas pedal on some sort of emotional issue. They will either directly talk about hot-button issues (like politics), or makes a vivid over the top parables and metaphors, or makes fun of bad/stupid people, which just grabs your attention. David Wong and Owen Cook often directly address their audience, calling out their weaknesses or insecurities, "yelling" at them to do better (in an inspiring way).

- Concise, clear, eloquent. Basically what PG does, and what HPMOR does much more artistically.
Honestly, those 3 things would already be enough. If I can write funny/insightful/engaging/clear, that would make it easy and fun to read. If I can also teach them something, theyd feel like theyre getting smarter and learning stuff, gaining value.
And by the way:
>> This kind of educational non-fiction writing has everything standup has, except it's much easier, and feels more valuable. Its just as engaging and has enough jokes, but doesnt have to be laugh out loud funny, just fun to read, and it can teach people things.
