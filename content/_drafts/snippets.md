This adventure was made by the [Adventure Writer's Room](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) community. We are a group of GMs who meet in the discord voice chat, and challenge ourselves to improvise a one-shot adventure in 2 hours. Our goal is to brainstorm fun ideas and improvise stories together in a chill, lighthearted, no-pressure environment. It works, it really helps with the writing, and it is super fun.

We're looking for some friendly and creative people to join us!

## Story Games

This adventure was made by the [Story Games](https://discord.gg/gNrJJNMuyD) community. We have improvised this story from scratch, during our game. 

We are a group of players who love improvisation and freeform roleplay. We create our characters, decide what adventure we want to go on, and then take turns GMing scenes for each other, trying to make up a fun story as we go. Think of it as a combination of freeform roleplay, brainstorming, and improv.

If that sounds like fun - learn more about our games [here](https://rpgadventures.io/story-games), and come [play with us](https://discord.gg/gNrJJNMuyD)!
