In this first sentence, tell the reader you're going to explain to them How To do.

Next, explain to the reader why they should want to learn how to do this thing. What benefits come with learning how to do this? What can they expect as an outcome or reward?

Now say, "Unfortunately..." and then tell the reader why so many people don't.

## This first subhead is the primary reason why.

Now, list out 4-5 other reasons people don't learn How To or struggle to make actionable progress.

-   Reason #1

-   Reason #2

-   Reason #3

-   Reason #4

Finally, give the reader a sentence of hope: you're going to explain to them how they can overcome all these problems you just laid out!

Here's how, step by step:

### **Step 1: Tell the reader exactly what to do. Be specific!**

In this first sentence, tell the reader why it's so important.

Next, give them a few quick examples. Either tell them how to do this in more detail, or maybe tell them a quick story of how someone else put this into action and what reward they unlocked as a result.

### **Step 2: Tell the reader exactly what to do. Be specific!**

Now, in this first sentence, tell the reader where so many go wrong when it comes to this second step.

Next, give a few quick examples. Explain why, in more detail, this is a mistake so many people make. And then, tell the reader what they need to do to avoid it.

### **Step 3: Tell the reader exactly what to do. Be specific!**

In this first sentence, motivate the reader by telling them of the light at the end of the tunnel.

Explain what this step, and the others before it, all ladder up to. Be specific, and give the reader hope as to what they can expect as a result of taking these steps.
