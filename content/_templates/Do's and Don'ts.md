Why not? Explain to the reader why they shouldn't do this thing if they want to achieve X. What will happen if they make this mistake? Get specific. What is going to happen to them, their life, their goals and dreams and aspirations, their family and sense of freedom? How bad can things get?

## Finally, in one bolded sentence, tell the reader how you made this very same mistake.

Now, show them. Show the reader how there was once a time when you didn't know what you are now explaining, and how you made this mistake. And using the above examples, show the reader how this mistake played out in your life. Get specific. What happened? What was the result of this mistake? What did you think was going to happen, and what happened instead?

Then, tell the reader, "Which is why I want to share this with you."

## In one bolded sentence, tell the reader what they should do instead.

Tell the reader, if you could go back in time, what you would do differently. What should the reader do instead? You've established all that can go wrong when you make this previous decision, now show the reader what life can look like on the other side—when you make the right decision.

List off a few specific examples of how good life can be, and what can be unlocked as a result of this decision.
