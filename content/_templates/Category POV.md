In your chosen category, share one commonly held belief most people think is true (but is actually false/wrong/outdated/misunderstood/etc.).

Next, describe the problem in detail. Explain to the reader why this commonly held belief is so prevalent in society, or how it became a commonly held belief in the first place. And finally, tell the reader what this commonly held belief has resulted in.

List off a few examples:

-   Example #1

-   Example #2

-   Example #3

## Now, in this subhead, tell the reader the reason this belief is flawed.

And in this first sentence, give the reader a concrete reason.

In this paragraph, expand on your argument. Share a personal story, or a study or stat that gives credibility and context to your perspective. And finally, tell the reader what new and different result they can expect if and when they abandon this old, commonly held belief and adopt this new perspective you're providing instead.

Now, tell them how:

### **In this subhead, tell them how to shift their mindset from "old" to "new."**

This first sentence is an actionable step they can take, right away.

Next, explain what they can expect as a result from shifting their mindset. What new advantages or benefits will they experience in their own life? Be specific, and paint a clear picture of the future.

### **Finally, in this subhead, tell the reader why the "old" is going away for good.**

Bring them back to the beginning of the article, and drive home your point.

Give a few quick reasons why the "old" is on its way out, and this "new" way of thinking is the future. And to send them off, give them one final reminder/example of what this new future will look likeâ€”and why it will be so valuable for them to be part of it.
