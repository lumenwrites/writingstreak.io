- Saving/Loading scenes.
- Outliner. Grouping, parenting, renaming.
- Select multiple objects. Manipulator in the middle of bbx. Marquee, shift.
- Object preferences (movement settings and name).
- Prefabs. Save them, list them.
- Updating (reimporting) the objects when the new asset is saved.
- Textures 
- Toolbar - move/rotate/scale tools.
- Switch into the fps pawn mode. And maybe car. tps.
- Drag with shift to duplicate is brilliant.
- I think I should have one file that processes all the inputs, maybe global, and then calls the functions inside the components. Keeping the: scattered all around the app will quickly make that unmanageable.
- Grid is blocking the cursor now. It should either be transparent to the cursor, or just be the solid ground like in talespire.
- Fix rotated scale.
- Search. Filter by big categories in dropdown.  
- Pick objects from scene instead of the asset browser.
- Tooltips
- Pan/focus camera.
- Outline shader.
- In placing mode, hold ctrl key to change the asset's elevation. hold shift to maintain height. Right click or spacebar or something+scrollwheel to turn it 90/45/15 degrees as Im placing it. press mmb to rotate 90 degrees Sample height.
- cut/copy/paste objects.
- Use the circular cursor, not the red one! Like in zombie zone. Faced in the direction of the normal.
- Make building work in first-person mode?
Modeling: Follow tutorials, copy the plugin the best I can.
- Select/move vertices. Then edges/faces. Scale/Rotate them. Delete.
- Extrude. //Edge loop, cut.
- Export to Gotm/sketchfab button. Click a button, and you have a thing you can instantly upload. In gotm case, maybe it's something you can instantly walk around in. Maybe there's a scene viewer UI where you walk around as a pawn, or as a top-down character, or as a car, and preview how that feels like.
- Replace asset types with different assets/prefabs. Replace all the floor tiles with different kind of floor tiles.
- Scroll wheel to switch asset type to another, similar asset. Like in divinity engine.
- Id need to fit the library of textures somewhere as well. Maybe a tab next to color.
- slabs you can copy paste from text
- I bet I could make a website where people can upload user created levels/slabs and assets.
- Organize modular assets in prefabs? Pick an asset from the prefab? Instead of a ton of disjointed house pieces, just place a house, and pick things from it.
- Draw bounding box manually. Theres a video in modeling tutorial series about drawing wireframes around objecrs. Or just do it the way I did the grid. Or figure out how to create a proper outline shader. 
- edit pivot
- highlight asset buttons on hover/select.


# Mapmaker
- Sidebar of assets. Create them on click, or, ideally, drag and drop (copy from the material maker).
- See if I can create my own splines.
- See what other functionality I can implement.
