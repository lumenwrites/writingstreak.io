#nextup TD
MVP:
- 3 tower types with unique bullets, fire rates, etc.
- 3 enemy types with unique speed and armor.
- Tower upgrades add multipliers to radius/damage/firerate/health.
- Enemy healthbars.
- Base healthbars.
- Money, towers cost money.
- Resources tower costs money, increases money.
- Waves. Randomized enemies.
- Enemies shoot back.
- Score, save score.
- Game over.
- Game speed.
- Sell tower. 

Next: 
- Targeting preferences. first/strong/weak/random.
- Tower stats menu.
- Tile bonuses
- Towers grayed out when there isnt enough money.
Preview fire radius on hover.
- Follow random path.
generate paths automatically from the roads?
- Build the first tower to start game?
- Enemies decrease in size instead of having healthbars?
Is it prettier or less satisfying?

Attack towers:
- Regular
- Fire
- Ice
Support towers:
- Healing
- Resources(solar energy)
   costs money and takes up valuable space?
- Support tower per upgrade - radius, damage, fire rate, shield.
- Research? (or is it just menu?)
   unlock upgrades and towers
   more research towers take up more space but research things faster
Blocking towers:
- Wall?
- Mine?
Tiles:
- Platforms with bonuses?
   With resources

Design ideas:
- Do you always need a resources gathering tower, do resources not get gathered by default? Maybe.
- Research only applies to towers within radius?
- Divinity-style resistances to damage types? To piercing/fire/ice?
In percentages? 
Or like armor/magearmor that needs to be depleted?
- Make sure that damage makes a difference. Subtracting enemy armor from damage. So low damage towers are very weak against armored enemies, and power upgrades feel like they make a difference. And make it clear to the player, if player doesnt understand the mechanic it might as well be noise.
- Money support tower isnt a requirement? Its just an expensive thing you can biy to add extra money on top of killing enemies? Or it could increase money collected from enemies for every tower within radius! To add extra strategy to this.
- Randomize time between waves?
Make all waves and types custom for each level?
- Upgrade research tower to do more/faster research?
- Research unlocks upgrades, or upgrades all the parameters at once.
- Research missiles!!
- And tower can switch between attack modes with different missiles!! Thats one more mechanic for cooler depth!At least fast and lightnvs slow and heavy?
- Builder's hut? Increases the speed of building?
- Supply depos? Number of towers is limited by supply depos?
- Storage to store extra reaources?
- Air defense tower? Electricity tower?
- Traps - slowdown pit trap? Poison trap? What else?
- Deploy troops on the road?
- damage types/resistances. regular/fire/ice/electricity
- anti-tower enemies

- Sniper tower
- Air tower(meh? just annoys me and takes up space? better have variety of resistances? or more mechanics for air specifically?)
- Multi shooter
- Omni directional
- Rocket launcher for heavy ones?
- Enemies should collide, so stunned enemies stop everyone behind them?
- Posion
- Water surfaces for only specific kinds of towers?
- Air enemy
- Electricity spreads between enemies and ignores armor
- Lead bloons. armor breakable by a certain kind of tower, butnthe rest can deal damage after that?
- Support tower - grant invisibility detection.
increase range, fire speed. support tower for every upgrade?
- Resources gathered from a radius, so that has something strategic to it? More resources are gathered when there are more enemies of a certain type. or resources are gathered from desd enemies, only when enemies die within radius!?
- Flying tower?
- Build platforms that allows you to build more towers? Like terraform or zerg poison?
- Towers that unlock fireball abilities and such! Click on a tower, use its attack manually!! Or each tower has rechargeable special attack you use manually.
its just more clicking and attentionsucking, but its a good kind.
- Tower experience is dumm, I dont like it. Its not something you control beyond placing it sooner, this is no fun.

Powers/blocks:
- Rain fire/explode
- Paralyze all enemies on screen
- Nuke a large area
- Destroy a lane of enemies in one direction, like a super ray
- hurt all enemies that pass through you
- turn all bullets that pass through you into fireballs, double the damage
- Some enemies can jump over obstacles or detect them!
-  Light up the area lettig you see through a fog
- Hit both ground and air targets
- slow down air enemies is a separate one
- add protective tower that shields towers behind it
- strip off the armor from enemies(but do no damage) 
- Build a platform allowing you to plant in unplantable area(level a mountain)
- 
they also have the water surfaces.
