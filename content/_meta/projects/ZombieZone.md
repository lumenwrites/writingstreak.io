- Fix zombie hands.
- Send it to reddit, send it to this week in godot.
- Just make the weapon disappear after awhile? If it's off screen?
// I should try adding nighttime lights, see if it's awesome.
// Animate lights, start at the nighttime, the objective is to survive till dawn?
// Balance the ammo better? Now theres too much of it, I want there to be an incentive to break crates and switch weapons.
//picked up weapon should be auto reloaded. New weapons already reloaded, it has clip ammo in it. Dropped weapon... could be reloaded but maybe it shouldnt, somyou couldnt drop it and re pick it up quickly? Just trigger the reload and let it take some time then. 
//Add one separate slot for powerup? The benefit of a separate power slot is that you can activate it without switching to it.
**Weapons**: 
//Self-guiding rockets or spiders.
// flamethrower (short range automatic area, pretty effect)
// chainsaw? Mechanically the same as flamethrower. And not much better then assault rifle, just requires less aim.
// Molotov to set things on fire
// Energy gun. requires charge, regenerates ammo.
// Light saber. Deflecting bullets would totally work, but require an alt fire. Just make a shield?
//Rocket launcher? Seems like a more boring version of a grenade, since it shoots in a straight line, and still has to hit, and area damage has no value unless you shoot at the wall. Or at the floor in fps. Rocket launcher aims at the ground where you're pointing? Meh...
Self guiding rockets? Maybe!! But you can't shoot them down, what fun is it... Well, maybe you can. A rocket aims at a target, its slow enough and is at the right size to be hit by a bullet, and it's self-guiding. Would be tough to implement the difference between players/bots... unless it has a zone around it and picks the first body that can take damage that isnt the owner!!
Self guidig rockets and self guiding exploding spiders would be mechanically the same, pick one,
//shotgun slow reload, shell by shell.
**Powers**:
// Wall. Or freeze grenade.
// Fight bots on yourside. Self-guiding exploding spiders? scuttle to the closest enemy, explode. - self guiding rockets.
// Cloaking Device. Pretend a tree, stealth, hide? For multiplayer.
A tool that makes the user invisible or disguises them as the enemy. It's most common. Make you invisible until you shoot?
transform into a tree/crate/barrell/enemy?
// Shield. Deflects bullets? People wouldnt shoot at it, but bots would. And people would if it gets depleted. How ismit better than armor?
//Movement speed. Just use melee weapons for that?
Dash at a cost of life force or armor? Replace armor with mana? 
// see through walls of the buildings.
//Time slow (for single player only)
//Bonuses to Damage, fire rate, accuracy, zoom - should just be properties of weapons.
//healing gun for team multiplayer
//grappling hook?
//vehicles
//drone for exploration?
//portal/gravity gun. Push enemies back? just pick up and move objects?
