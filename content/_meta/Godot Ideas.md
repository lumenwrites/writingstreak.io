  - DnD

## Software
- 2D Map Maker
        Vector shapes:
            - Grid with snapping.
            - Draw shapes with editable points to make rooms.
                Drawing overlapping shapes merges the splines.
                It draws the floors and the walls.
            - Portal tool - doors openable in splines.
            - Cave brush draws floors and walls around them.
            - Draw patterns - just spline shapes with textures. Editable points.
            - Water brush, material brush. Just like caves, noisy spline
            - Smooth bezier path tool with different textures.
            // Roof tool.
        Brushes
            - Terrain brush. Just drawing.
                Except it doesn't just save pixel values.
                There are 4 types of terrain. And you're drawing masks, I'm assuming.
                And you can switch biomes which switches textures.
        Objects
            - Object library. All assets, search, used, tags.
                Place object. Rotation/scale.
            - Object manipulation. Select objects, scale, rotate, move, delete, duplicate.
            //Scatter tool.
        Prefabs (groups)
            - Combine multiple objects into a prefab.
            - Place prefabs, edit prefabs like objects, separate them.
        Renderign
            - Place lights. Objects block lights.
        Other
            - Layers
            - Text tool(font, size, color).
            - Change map size (in tiles).
            - Open/save/export/etc.
            - Undos, backups,
            - Asset packs.
- Simple box modeler:
        - Create boxes.
        - Select.
        - Move/Rotate/Scale.
        - Delete.
        - Colorize.
        - Move vertices.
        - Group.
        - Snap to grid.
