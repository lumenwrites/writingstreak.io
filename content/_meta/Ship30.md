Hey, everyone! I'm Lumen (`@lumenwrites` on twitter). I'm a startup founder, web developer, and a writer.

My goal is to help entrepreneurs and content creators to leverage technology and online writing to grow their audience and build profitable businesses. I will be writing about online writing (meta, I know), startups, and how to cross-apply the best ideas between these two fields to help startup founders grow their audience, and to help writers to build and grow online businesses.

I'm also working on an app (called Writing Streak) that helps writers to develop a daily writing habit. I've launched a new version a couple of days ago, and I'm looking forward to beta-testing it on myself. If I succeed at writing every day for the next 30 days, that will be a huge victory!

I'd love to get to know all of you guys, learn from you, exchange advice and feedback, and I'll do my best to help you where I can.

Don't hesitate to message me for any reason - I'll be happy to share my thoughts/feedback on your work, answer questions, give advice, or just chat. I'm still an aspiring writer, but I am pretty damn good at web development and design, so feel free to ask me questions on these subjects. Let's get to know each other and help each other to successfully win this course!

As for hobbies, I love table-top roleplaying games, game development (Godot for the win!), digital art, and watching StarKid musicals =)
