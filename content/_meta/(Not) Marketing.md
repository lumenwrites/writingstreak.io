 That's ALL the marketing lmw needs and is ever gonna get. It will not work and thats fine - I need my brain to feel good about posting, but NOT obsess over marketing.

The ONLY point of lumenwrites is to get me the clarity/focus of writing, which is hard, boring, but worth it. This is the complete opposite of social media.
The point of having a website at all is to make my brain feel like it can be POTENTIALLY discovered, which feels good. Same is true for twitter.
Every time I make a post, I get to share it on twitter/mastodon. It won't work in any meaningful way, it doesn't need to. Don't expect results, there won't be any. And if I can't stop I'll have to quit sharing it entirely, because it'll be the opposite of healthy, mess up the dopamine and ruin the whole thing.

If I cant stop thinking about marketing - I will have to stop the whole thing entirely. Id still be able to post and organzie my notes, but I'll have to conclude that it is unhealthy and breaks my info diet and ruins my life, and therefore I cant do any social media posting at all.

Every time I post I get to:
- Submit to mastodon/twitter ONCE, as long as I never look at it again or expect any results (which I'm not gonna get), and can avoid obsessing over notifications. 
- Push it to my email subscribers (once I have any). 
Not any time soon, so don't even think about it.
- If I ever write a HN/IH/LW/SSC worthy post, I can submit there, that's fine.
If the post is REALLY good. Not any time soon, so don't even think about it.

Now I declare that I proactively refuse to do ANYTHING else about marketing my posts, or even thinking/learning about it, or "researching" what other people do on twitter, because that DOES break my info diet from now on. I wont count what I did before against myself, but Im stopping right now because backsliding into my addiction is the absolute worst thing I can do to myself.
