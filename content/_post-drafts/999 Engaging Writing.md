# Make Writing Engaging
Some people (like Scott Alexander, Paul Graham, and David Wong) make their writing very easy and fun to read. Why are some articles so much more engaging than others?

Here are some things I have noticed.

**Simple and clear language**. They're not using the fancy words to impress your with their vocabulary - they impress you with their clever and insightful ideas, communicated clearly. They **choose words that convey ideas as simply and plainly as possible**, which make them easy to read.

<!-- They don't explain things in a convoluted or needlessly sophisticsted way to demonstrate how smart they are. Instead, t -->

**Brevity** - they don't use more words than they must, they have a high ideas to wordcount ratio.

Their writing is **insightful** - they talk about clever ideas I've never heard of before, they explain complicated concepts in simple and accessible ways. I feel like some of this genuinely makes me smarter (I hope), and some of it is just insight porn - they evoke a pleasant sensation in my brain of having learned something, and that gives me a little rush of dopamine, which keeps me reading.

Their writing is **useful**. I can see how Paul Graham's ideas can be useful in my life - I want to build a startup, and his writing clarifies the path towards it. Eliezer Yudkowsky teaches rationality, and that also feels useful, though less directly. Scott Alexander's ideas are less practically applicable to my life, but he still makes me feel like I'm learning stuff and getting smarter.

<!-- EY and AR teach rationality, Tyler teaches social skills, Wong and SSC teach whatever insigtful ideas they're curious about and researched. 
They're passionate about what they're talkign about.

They're **funny**, they regularly use jokes or witty turns of phrase. I feel like this is one of the most important factors in engaging writing, but I still don't know how to actually do this, I don't have a formula for being funny on command.

They write with **authority and conviction**. I think this is something anyone should be able to do - avoid countless disclaimers, **have strong opinions**, express them with conviction. It's much more interesting to read than the insecure authors constantly hedging their bets, and it's not at odds with being rational and open minded. Eliezer Yudkowsky, Ayn Rand, and Owen Cook are my favorite examples of speaking with conviction. they care deeply and passionately about something, see the world from a certain perspective, and unapologetically express it.

A cool trick I have learned by listening to Harmontown (a podcast by Dan Harmon, the author of Community and Rick and Morty) is that it *doesn't even matter* which opinion you have. Often Dan will just **pick a strong stance** and rant about something ridiculous, like some minor annoyance or a movie he disliked. This makes him almost automatically entertaining to listen to.

**Make abstract ideas concrete**, by using specific real-life examples, vivid metaphors, interesting thoughts experiment. Almost any article or a podcast discussing abstract ideas becomes instantly more entertaining when the authors try to list specific examples of a general idea.

Cause **emotional spikes** - both David Wong and Scott Alexander say things that feel like pushing a gas pedal on some sort of emotional issue. They will either directly talk about hot-button issues (like politics), or makes a vivid over the top parables and metaphors, or makes fun of bad/stupid people, which just grabs your attention. David Wong and Owen Cook often directly address their audience, calling out their weaknesses or insecurities, "yelling" at them to do better (in an inspiring way).

(imagine your loved one lying on the street bleeding out, and you urgently need a doctor) 


- Concise, clear, eloquent. Basically what PG does, and what HPMOR does much more artistically.
Honestly, those 3 things would already be enough. If I can write funny/insightful/engaging/clear, that would make it easy and fun to read. If I can also teach them something, theyd feel like theyre getting smarter and learning stuff, gaining value.
And by the way:
>> This kind of educational non-fiction writing has everything standup has, except it's much easier, and feels more valuable. Its just as engaging and has enough jokes, but doesnt have to be laugh out loud funny, just fun to read, and it can teach people things.


concrete examples

Another important thing is writing is to treat everything like a story.

For example, you could say "Statistic Y shows Z is true." That's boring and dry. OR you could say "I was wondering about X. Can I really live longer if I just... and so I looked into this and this, then I thought, could it be B? But no, that doesn't fit, because... but wait! Z seems to fit... etc."

Take the reader through the story of your discovery/dilemma/thesis! Makes it much more human.



Action Checklisr
- Add jokes

- Specific vivid metaphor. First, picture a monkey. A monkey dressed like a little pirate, if that helps you. We'll call him Slappy. Now, imagine you get four more monkeys. We'll call them Tito, Bubbles, Marcel and ShitTosser. Imagine personalities for each of them now. Maybe one is aggressive, one is affectionate, one is quiet, the other just throws shit all the time. But they're all your personal monkey friends. Now imagine a hundred monkeys.
   It's like this: which would upset you more, your best friend dying, or a dozen kids across town getting killed because their bus collided with a truck hauling killer bees?
   "LEARN TO FUCKING DRIVE, FUCKER!!" Try to imagine acting like that in a smaller group. Like if you're standing in an elevator with two friends and a coworker, and the friend goes to hit a button and accidentally punches the wrong one. Would you lean over, your mouth two inches from her ear, and scream "LEARN TO OPERATE THE FUCKING ELEVATOR BUTTONS, SHITCAMEL!!"
   That's why you get that weird feeling of anonymous invincibility when you're sitting in a large crowd, screaming curses at a football player you'd never dare say to his face.
   Strangely enough, if the kindly lone toy making guy made enough toys and hired enough people and expanded to enough shops, we'd eventually stop seeing it as a toy-making shop and start seeing it as the fiery Orc factories of Mordor.
- Set up and break the pattern. family and neighbors, and then maybe some classmates or coworkers or church or suicide cult.
- Story/example. Russert's dad used to take half an hour to carefully box up any broken glass before taking it to the trash. Why? Because "The trash guy might cut his hands."
- Coin the term. The Monkeysphere (dunbar's number).
- Push emotional buttons.
- Know problems cannot be solved with clever slogans and over-simplified step-by-step programs. You can do that by following these simple steps.
- ?? That brain, of course, was human. Probably from a homeless man they snatched off the streets.
- So, we don't think of him as a person. We think of him as The Thing That Makes The Trash Go Away.
- I mean, they're not people. They're teachers
- Oh, not much. It's just the one single reason society doesn't work.
- You may have a list of rationalizations long enough to circle the Earth, 
- so they taught us to get a personal idea of a God in our heads who says, "No matter who you hurt, you're really hurting me. Also, I can crush you like a grape."
- is an inhuman soul-grinding greed machine
- Now, the cold truth is this Bin Laden is just as desperately in need of a bullet to the skull as the raving four-color caricature on some redneck's T-shirt. The key to understanding people like him, though, is realizing that we are the caricature on his T-shirt.
- Then watch that same kid at work, as he drops a hamburger patty on the floor, picks it up, and slaps in on a bun and serves it to a customer. In that one dropped burger he has everything he needs to understand those black-hearted politicians and corporate bosses.
- This is why they rarely go to war, though when they do it is widely thought to be hilarious
- For the monkeys it was a confused, comical, tree-humping disaster.
- That man, of course, was German philosopher Hans Capitalism. Then, some time in the Third Century, French philosopher Pierre "Frenchy" LaFrench invented racism.
- Even Gandhi may have had hotel rooms and dead hookers in his past.
SSC:
- You tried Carol Dweck’s Growth Mindset, but the replication crisis crushed your faith. You tried Mike Cernovich’s Gorilla Mindset, but your neighbors all took out restraining orders against you. And yet, without a mindset, what separates you from the beasts? 
- through long years of hard labor in the rationality mines
-  This is the bias that explains why your political opponents continue to be your political opponents, instead of converting to your obviously superior beliefs.
