I struggle to come up with promising startup ideas. I define a promising idea as something that:

- I can build.
- Is valuable enough for people to pay money for.
- Has a marketing strategy (a way for me to put it in front of the people who need it).
- I care enough about to be motivated to work on it.

So what should I do when I don't have a promising project idea that satisfies all these constraints?

# Keep Learning

# Keep Building

12 months levelsuo

# Run healthy loops

In the absense of the perfect idea, work on the best one you have.
learn problems
learn tools
default to healthy loops
do simple work
obvious, straightforward, predictable
writing opens up marketing strategies
