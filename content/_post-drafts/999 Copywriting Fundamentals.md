# Notes
1. Describe the problem the way they would describe it. 
	Great copy uses words your target consumer is using.
	To find these words, create an autobiography.
	Clearly define their: Wants Needs Fears Hopes Dreams Friends Enemies
	Then, describe the problem.
	You can also ask your customers to describe their problem.
	Send a survey asking:
	• What's most frustrating about the problem?
	• What's wrong with current solutions to the problem?
	• What is the problem preventing you from achieving?
2. Create solutions that solve their problem, but sell the benefits.
	Your product should solve their problem. 
	But no one cares about your product. They care about what it can do for them.
3. Make them feel they can't go on without your product.
	• Promise ease. Your product makes it easy. 
	• Sell the dream. Your product makes it possible. 
	• Sell the benefits. Your product makes it better.
	• Give something away for free, but say there's more inside.
4. Close with compassion.
	If your product actually solves a problem, you should feel great about closing.
	You are improving their life. Make it known that's how you feel. 
	Pretend you are convincing a loved one that you think this is best for them.
