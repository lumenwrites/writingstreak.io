# Get the Most out of this Course

## Learn by Doing
It's important to take action and apply what you're learning. Don't just read through the course in one sitting - commit to writing an adventure. You will learn much better if you immediately apply the ideas you're learning into practice.

## Set an Attainable Goal
Clearly define what you want to accomplish by the end of this course. When you're going through the course for the first time, I highly recommend you to aim to write a one-page adventure, like the ones you see on [our website](https://rpgadventures.io/).

This goal is attainable, unintimidating, and limited in scope. You're extremely likely to accomplish it successfully, which will give you the confidence to pursue more ambitious projects later on (like longer adventures and campaigns). Successfully completing a small project is much better than taking on something vast and intimidating, getting stuck, and losing motivation.

## Set the Deadlines
The writing process outlined in this course can be completed in two hours (if you're doing a realtime brainstorming session with a group of people, like we sometimes do in our community), or in two weeks (if you're busy, working on the adventure on your own, and want to take your time with each step), or in any amount of time in between - it takes as much time as you're willing to put into it. If you're working on a very long adventure or a campaign, it might take even longer.

Having said that, I'm designing this course to be completed in two weeks. The Adventure Brainstorming section has 7 parts and the Adventure Writing section has 7 parts, so I recommend aiming to complete one lesson per day (each lesson taking 1-2 hours).

<!-- consistent writing schedule, morning hours -->

## Avoid Perfectionism
Each lesson has action steps you need to take. Don't try to complete them perfectly, instead - do the best you can within the time-frame that you have.

Looking for the perfect idea is one of the major causes of the writer's block - people get stuck feeling unsatisfied with the ideas they have, or feeling the choice paralysis when trying to pick the best idea out of the list.

Lower your expectations for how good you think an idea should be - ideas build on top of each other and evolve as you go through the writing process. It's much easier to improve the simple idea you already have than to come up with something brilliant out of the blue. Even a simple and obvious idea will turn into something interesting and unique by the time you're done with your adventure. 

Don't get it right, just get it written.  The most important thing is to successfully complete the simplest playable adventure, just make it exist - you can alaways go back and improve it later. If you move at a steady pace and complete the adventures regularly, instead of getting stuck on one project and trying to make it perfect - you will grow much faster as a writer, be more productive, and the overall quality of your work will increase.

## Write a New Adventure
The first time you go through this course - I recommend starting from scratch and writing a new adventure, rather than continuing to work on the ideas you've been working on already.

This will help you to experience the whole creative process, which includes deliberately generating new ideas from scratch.

This will also help you to write without the weight of the expectations you may have if you've been struggling with a big project and getting nowhere. Take this course as as an opportunity to experiment, to try something new.

## Planning, Organizing, Goals, Tools

Tools, not rules. This process works, and I recommend you to experience it at least once, but then feel free to tweak it according to your needs - simplify.
