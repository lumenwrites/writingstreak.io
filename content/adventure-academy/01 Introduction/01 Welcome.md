# Welcome to the Adventure Academy!
Welcome! Thanks for joining! I hope you're excited, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what you will create using the things you'll learn here!

Before we begin the course, make sure to join our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/JZmXfWD85D). You will get much more out of the course if you interact with the other people interested in writing adventures, actively engage in discussion, share your experience, ask questions, ask for help if you get stuck, and help other people to brainstorm their ideas (which will help you to have more ideas of your own).

After joining our community, make sure to send me an email (`lumenwrites@gmail.com`) with your Discord handle and I will give you access to the private channels available only to the students of this course.

## Contact
If you have any questions or encounter any issues, don't hesitate to contact me:

## Action Steps
- Send me a message over email or discord with your discord username, so that I could give you access to the private category in our server available only to the students in this course.
- Go to the `#student-introductions` channel and tell us a bit about yourself!


<!--
My goal in this course is to give you a straightforward step-by-step guide to creating your own adventures. By the end of this course you will have a creative process you can use to go from a blank page to a complete adventure you can run for your players or publish.
