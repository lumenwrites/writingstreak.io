# Intro
Isnt designed to teach beginners how to run games for the first time.
Get more out of your rpgs by preparing less.
No game-specific mechanics.
Designed to maximize the value you get out of reading it, 
complete encapsulation of the path of the lazy dungeon master, if you want to follow this path - this is the only book you need.
Each chapter is deliberately brief, designed to get you to the meat of the topic as quickly as possible.
Skim TOC, see what you already know.
Course overview. If you read nothing else - read the chapter outlining all the makn steps.
End (beginning) of each chapter includes a checklist covering the main points the chapter contains.
Read them to review what each chapter contains, and if you want to review without rereading. If you want to dive deeper into becoming a great dugeon master - these references are the best place to start.
Read the book in whatever way best suits your needs. Read cover to cover or skim the contents and pick out whatever topics most interest you.
If you find that these concepts resonate with you - you can reread it regularly, to wire these comcepts into your creative process.
Although it presents complete checklist, each idea stands on it's own. 
Take the parts that work well for you, and omit those that do not.
Whatever way gives you the greatest benefit.

The end of the course includes a list of references and further reading.
Prep as little as you can.

# Lazy GM Way
Prepare what benefits your game. Most value per time/energy spent.
We spend a lot of time working on things that don't benefit the game.
Boil prep down to things that matter the most,
The less we prepare, the better our games will be

# Description
Briefer. brevity. - more impact, hold reader to story.
Manage the learning curve, don't throw a bunch of names/concepts/exposition at them. Doll out information as it becomes relevant.

Use Active voice

Try to avoid using adverbs and adjectives, and find the right verb or noun instead.
> 
- “he walked quietly” is not as good as “he crept”.

Use precise instead of generic ones.

Pyramid of abstraction.
Build a foundation of concrete language. You can add things that are more abstract.
love dog golden retriever
more concrete - pull down the pyramid. describe color, size, etc.
easy to make it more concrete with more words.

active voice, concrete descriptions.
pain coarsed through him => he moved his arm and winced in pain


Do multiple things. setting, tone, worldbuilding infodump.
precise words.
wooden bed => oak bed 
big dog => shaggy rotweiler
big sword => x machete
scary sword rusty machete
old sword =
wretched hag => old woman
lavish room => smelled of fine wine and gleam of emeralds
evoke setting
dog that has not yet been caught and eaten.
evoke worldbuilding, character
well bred hunting hound, who would lose one of those?
multiple senses - dog is whimpering and you catch a whiff of wet hair.
and smelled wet.

Show dont tell.

More concrete
Do more than one thing.
5 senses. More than just 

very mad is worse than irate. more words, less concrete.

ground players in the world with concrete descriptions.
to be.ieve that theres a big political problem, describe one small specific instance of it that impacts the characters.

character wants something, they try to proactively get what they want, you explain just enough worldbuilding to explain what!s going on. explain things as they come up.

# Setting
Physical (everything that would exist if people werent involved) and Cultural.
magic.
Physical: geography, flora fauna, weather. All that can make setting more inique and interesting.

# Dialogue
Motivation. Make sure they're motivated internally, not by the plot.
Individuality. Unique words, phrases, mannerisms. can tell characters apart without tags. catch phrases. word choice, dialogue, passive or aggressive, excited or calm, rhythm and pattern.
conflict
realism - believable
objective - what writer wants out of the scene.

writing dialogue doesnt make much sense in adventures does it.

# Villains
Dont make villains who are evil for evil sake.
Give them opposite goals from hero, but justified motivations. They want to achieve something bad, but...
Possible to identify with them.
see where theyre coming from.
legitemate threat, good at what he does.
Competent, proactive, well defined motivations, know why theyre doing what theyre doing.
everyones a hero of their own story.
Have their own passions aside from just defeating the hero.

Magic Systems

#  Sample adventure

# Adventure breakdowns

# Reskinning (lazygm)

#  Canpaigns
Spiral - decelop only the starting location and npcs, start with what matters tomthe characters the most right now. Dont develop far away cities until players get to them.
Campaign hook - single simple goal anyone can understand.
defeat the sorcerer queen, stop the rise of the demon prince, destroy the religious dark empire, recover the 6 blades of power, restore the displaced king to his throne, defeat the 5 dark titans, stop the war waged by orc emperor, prevent the resurrection of the dark lord.
6 truths - doesnt mean anything. 6 unique things about the world. 
3 fronts - 3 major actors in the campaign. like weather fronts. main one is the villain, a looming cataclysmic event.
Who/what is the front.
What is it trying to accomplish.
Where is it headed.
Do they think theyre justified in their actions?
3 grim portents. What 3 visible steps show the progress of this front.
- Villain, wants to construct the war machine and level a peaceful village.
- Hobgoblin restores the machine, Villain hunts down a gemstone needed to power the war machine, opens the gates and sends the war machine after the village.

# Session 0
Set expectations, establish the world, establish connections between the player characters. Give them clear motivation.

#  Running your game
Flexibility, creativity, improvisation.
Relax, play
listen more than you talk
yes and
Work
Dont 

trust the process

use guiding questions
- describe your killing blow
- whats an interesting physical characteristic of this monster/tavern?
- what happens during your journey? (during travel)
set the stage describing what journey will be like, where it wil, take place, interesting general features of the area.
ask to describe an interesting event that occurs as you travel?
describe a challenge the group faces, but not how the party overcomes it (another player may describe that)

# Improvising npcs
Choose a name (using lists and generators)
Let the details come out organically as you roleplay, improvise
Lift a character from a movie and switch alignment/gender, use cliche with a twist

#  improvising scenes and situations
Let the world react to players.
Model the npcs,put yourself in the mind of the villain. and do what they would do.
Do what makes sense in the context of the story, act the way it would make sense to act.

#  Improv
Yes and, dont shoot the ideas down
react to the players, build on players ideas.
be obvious, do what makes sense.
playing characters - status.
stories are about change in status.
establish the base reality (routine, platform) and then change it (break the routine, tilt)
establish open questions, create mystery
deliver on your promises (chechov's gun)
reincorporate, use callbacks, make the elements you have established early on to pay off (even if you didnt plan it in advance, just reincorporate what happened before).

Dont delay the payoff (by putting artificial obstacles in front of people). Do the rick and morty thing - get to the exciting stuff and then see what happens next.

Introduce something unexpected you don't understand, justify it later.
introduce fictiona element, or an emotion - you create a mystery out of nowhere by introducing a weird thing, then you "solve" it by justifying it.

#  Secrets and clues
you dont need to know how character might find them
drop them into adventure as you improvise
improvise discoveries 
abstract it away
drop right clues at the right time to help them solve it.
you know what the characters will discover but not how
secrets only become real when revealed. if they never come across that secret, it might be that the kingd goon is exactly what they said all along
