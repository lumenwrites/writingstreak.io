# ToDo
## NextUp
- There are 6 steps to writing, not 7. I can have one more.
- Improve adventure hook section.
- Improve Climax section.
- Put more of the best of my collected prompts as examples.
- Intro sections (minimal)
- First few lessons.
- Exciting Idea or Exciting Preimse?
- Launch
- Write an example adventure (or use one I already have). Sample adventure template.
- What to say on the welcome page?
- Don't forget to replace the social image once I have enough of a course to make a pretty screenshot.
- Create word of mouth growth driver? At least have a section asking people to share. Possibly an incentive.
- I'll have to license an image.

## Question
- Do I need a separate "storytelling theory" section? Or just put everything into the steps? Maybe just have intermittent chapters between the steps introducing the theory?
## Launch
- Should I launch on DMAcademy? Should I message the mods first? Should I use a fake account? It would minimize my chances of getting banned, but if it's too obvious then it'll look shadier in case I want to promote it in the future (for example with the free adventures, which is the sustainable path that worked).
- Launch it on discord (my server and others), give away the free version for a couple of weeks, premium lifetime to anyone who gives me feedback. Free and easy way to get some feedback and grow my server! Possibly on some subreddits too. 
- Ask the mods of dndbehindthescreen and dmacademy if I can launch the free version for "feedback"? Hey, it's still free value. Also tell them to leave feedback in my discord server (to grow it for free). And it's temporary, I can always make it premium later.
- Launch my sample adventure.
## Future
- Affinity Publisher adventure template.
- Adventure checklist.
