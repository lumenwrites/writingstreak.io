# ToDo
## NextUp
- Finish the Descriptions lesson. I don't have much to say on my own, but I can do research. Brandon sanderson lectures, reddit replies, internet articles, screenwriting books.
- Read through the StorytellingCollective, LazyGM, and Play Unsafe. Possibly also Write About Dragons, The Idea, Screenwriting for Hollywood, Writing Vivid Settings, Screenwriting Bible. Apply all the useful ideas.
- Write an example adventure (or use one I already have). Sample adventure template.
- Read through the whole course, obvious fixes/improvements.
- Improve the landing page by swiping from storytellingcollective.
Improve:
- More examples from my prompts.
- Improve Climax section, need more advice.
- Exciting Idea or Exciting Preimse? Change template if premise makes more ssense.
- What else to say on the welcome page? More intro sections?
- Use Vivid Settings sensory examples in my descriptions chapter.

Website:
- Don't forget to replace the social image once I have enough of a course to make a pretty screenshot.
To Improve:
--- 
Launch/Market:
- Share it on my server, ask for feedback.
- Make a post on r/DnD, find a couple of students to go through the course.
- See if I can convince the DMAcademy mods to let me make a post.
- Run ads on subreddits.
- Market using free adventures.
## NextUp
- Improve Climax section.
- Put more of the best of my collected prompts as examples.
- Intro sections (minimal)
- Exciting Idea or Exciting Preimse?
- Write an example adventure (or use one I already have). Sample adventure template.
- What else to say on the welcome page?
- Don't forget to replace the social image once I have enough of a course to make a pretty screenshot.
- I need read it and see whatever obvious emberassinf mistakes I can find, whatever improvements I can make.
- Do the descriptions/dialogue chapter.
- 
## To Improve
- Improve Key Plot Points Climax section. What else is there to say?
- Use more of my prompts as examples.
- Write down the lesson conclusions, what you have accomplished this lesson?
- Multiple climax resolutions?
- Add a name for your adventure
## Question
- Do I need a separate "storytelling theory" section? Or just put everything into the steps? Maybe just have intermittent chapters between the steps introducing the theory?
- Separate document with all the examples/prompts collected? Web page, PDF?
## Launch
- Should I launch on DMAcademy? Should I message the mods first? Should I use a fake account? It would minimize my chances of getting banned, but if it's too obvious then it'll look shadier in case I want to promote it in the future (for example with the free adventures, which is the sustainable path that worked).
- Launch it on discord (my server and others), give away the free version for a couple of weeks, premium lifetime to anyone who gives me feedback. Free and easy way to get some feedback and grow my server! Possibly on some subreddits too. 
- Ask the mods of dndbehindthescreen and dmacademy if I can launch the free version for "feedback"? Hey, it's still free value. Also tell them to leave feedback in my discord server (to grow it for free). And it's temporary, I can always make it premium later.
- Launch my sample adventure.
## Market
## Future
- Affinity Publisher adventure template.
- Adventure checklist.
- I'll have to license an image.
