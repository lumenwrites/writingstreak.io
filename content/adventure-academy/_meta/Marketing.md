# Coaching Offer Mod Request
**Can I make a post where I offer free adventure writing help to people in this subreddit?**

Hi! My name is Mike, I'm a DnD adventure writer. Currently I'm working on an adventure writing course - I want to share my writing process and teach people everything I know about storytelling and roleplaying games.

To make my course better, I would really like to find a couple of people willing to go through the course and give me some feedback.

I would give them free access to the course, guide them through the process of making their own adventure, answer their questions, do my best to help them to successfully complete their story. And they would give me some feedback that will help me to get better at teaching.

Is it okay if I make a post and make this offer to people in this community?

(Everything I'm offering is entirely free and no-strings-attached. The post will contain no links, and I will not be trying to sell anything. I'll just ask two or three people to send me a message if they would like to participate in this project.)

# Writers' Room Coaching Offer
Hey @everyone! Who wants to learn how to create one-shot adventures? 

I'm working on an adventure writing course, and I want to offer free coaching to a couple of novice GMs. I want to teach you everything I have learned over the past year and guide you through writing your story. I will show you how to brainstorm ideas, come up with plots/settings/characters/encounters, outline the adventures, write and playtest them. If all goes well, in a couple of weeks you will have created and published a one-shot adventure.

I will do my best to help you every step of the way, answer all of your questions, help you to stay motivated and accountable to keep working on this project. And you will give me some feedback that will help me to improve my course and get better at teaching.

You don't need to have any experience with writing and storytelling (it's actually better if you don't, novice people will get the most value out of this course), but you do need to be curious and passionate about this, and willing to dedicate a little bit of time every day for a couple of weeks to the writing process.

If that sounds interesting - send me a message. We start on Monday, November 1st. 

(Right now I can accept at most 3 students, but if all goes well and there's enough interest, I'll be happy to run the course again for more students.)

Hey guys! Who wants to learn how to create one-shot adventures? 

I have spent the last year writing one-page adventures and learning everything I can about storytelling. Writing used to be very difficult, creativity doesn't come naturally to me, and I constantly struggled with the writers' block. But I have ended up designing a process that works really well for me and for other people, makes all the steps straightforward and clear. Me and my friends have used this process to create and run a bunch of one-shot adventures, and they turned out to be really fun.

Now I'm working on an adventure writing course, and I want to offer free coaching to a couple of novice GMs. I want to teach you everything I know and guide you through writing your story. I will show you how to brainstorm ideas, come up with plots/settings/characters/encounters, outline the adventures, write and playtest them. If all goes well, in a couple of weeks you will have created and published a one-shot adventure. 

We will communicate over discord, I will write and send you the lectures, the students will share their progress and experience in the chat (and hopefully help each other and inspire each other as well). I will do my best to help you every step of the way, answer all of your questions, help you to stay motivated and accountable to keep working on this project. And you will give me some feedback that will help me to get better at teaching.

# Discord Launch
Hey, @everyone!

I wrote down everything I have learned about creating adventures and turned it into a course:
https://academy.rpgadventures.io/

My goal is to create a simple step-by-step guide to crearing adventures that anyone can follow to create an adventure from scratch, from the idea, to playtesting, to publishing. I think you guys will find it interesting.

I'd really love it if you could take a look at it and let me know what you think:
- Did you find the course useful?
- Are the instructions clear and easy to follow?
- Is there anything missing, anything I could've done better?
- Any other thoughts/ideas/feedback?

The course will stay free for the next couple of weeks, so that everyone in this community has a chance to check it out. After that I will launch it to the wider internet and start selling it, but I'll be happy to grant free lifetime access to anyone here who will take a look at it and send me some feedback.

## Phase
Hi! I have created a course where I wrote down everything I know about how to create adventures: https://academy.rpgadventures.io/

I think if it's successful, it'd be a nice way to make some money, and it would also help me to grow the server (I explain to people the whole brainstorming process and invite them to participate).

When you have some time, could you take a look and let me know what you think?
