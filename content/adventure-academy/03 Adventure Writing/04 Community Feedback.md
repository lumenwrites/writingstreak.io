# Community Feedback
Now you basically have a solid draft of your adventure, and all that's left is to try to polish it, make minor improvements, make it the best it can be.

## Request Feedback
The first step is to go to the communities once again, and ask for their thoughts, constructive criticism, feedback, and help with coming up with more ideas and improvements.

Use the Reddit's hivemind. If you get stuck - make a post on [/r/DMAcademy](https://old.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy), [/r/DnDAdventureWriter](https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDAdventureWriter), and our `#writing-help-and-feedback` channel, and ask people for help.

Here's a post template you can use to increase your chances of receiving quality feedback:
```
Title: I'm working on an adventure about <one-sentence pitch for your adventure>. I could really use some feedback and some help with brainstorming ideas.

**Summary:** 
<A short 2-4 sentence summary of the whole adventure. The problem players will try to solve or goal they'll try to achieve, what makes it difficult.>

You can see the current draft of the adventure here:
<link to the adventure>

**Outline:** 
<Brief descriptions of the main scenes. Key plot points, challenges you'd like your players to face.> 

**Key Characters:** 
<Brief one-sentence descriptions of the Main Antagonist, Quest Giver, and other important NPCs.>

**Key Locations:**
<Brief descriptions of the most important locations the players will visit.>

**Specific Questions:**
<A list of specific questions you'd like some help with. What's confusing you, where do you feel stuck, what kind of feedback are you looking for?>
```

Here's a few examples of my old posts: [1](https://old.reddit.com/r/DndAdventureWriter/comments/i145kt/zeppelin_heist_players_need_to_rescue_a_rebel/), [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/DndAdventureWriter/comments/nefh7s/onepage_adventure_about_prehistoric_tribes/), [3](https://old.reddit.com/r/DndAdventureWriter/comments/nuoil8/im_working_on_a_onepage_adventure_about/), [4](https://old.reddit.com/r/DndAdventureWriter/comments/hhyy75/can_you_help_me_design_a_oneshot_adventure_based/).

Engage with the community, talk to people, ask some follow up questions.

## Incorporate Feedback
Hopefully this process will sound familiar to you. Read through the comments, see if you can find constructive criticism that is really valid, or cool ideas that are really useful, and add them to the ToDo list of things you want to improve about your adventure.

Then go through the list and try to make the tweaks and improvements.
