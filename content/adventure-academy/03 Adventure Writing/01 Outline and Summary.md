# Outline and Summary

Congratulations! You have completed the brainstorming part of your adventure writing process! You have filled in your Brainstorming Template, and now you should have all the information you know in order to write the adventure. With all the ideas already in place, it will be surprisingly easy and rewarding.

For the rest of the course you will be using your Adventure Writing Template to outline, draft, and complete your adventure.

## Summarize the Whole Story
At the beginning of your template, write down a very short (2-4 sentences) summary of your adventure. Try to mention all the most important components of your idea:

> **Summary**
- What is the main idea for this adventure, exciting premise for this story?
- What Objective will the players strive to achieve?
- Why is it important, what's at stake? What makes it difficult to accomplish?
- What challenges will they face, what will they need to do to overcome them?
- What complications will they encounter?
- What will the climax be, the “final battle” that resolves the problem/goal?

The goal is to get the birds-eye view of the story, see if it makes sense and sounds fun to play. When you share your adventure with other people, this is the paragraph you will use to get them excited about the adventure and convince them to continue to read it. When inviting players to your game, this is the description you will use (minus the spoilers) to make them curious to join.

## Create an Outline
First, you need to create an outline of your adventure. This is where you combine all the ideas you have brainstormed, put it all together into a list of scenes that flow into each other, add up to an interesting story that makes sense.

You already know the Key Plot Points of your story and the Challenges the players will face, and now you just need to turn them into the list of scenes.

**Typical Adventure Outline** looks like this:
- **Introduction**  
Exposition, setup. Introduce the heroes and the world around them. Where do the heroes begin the adventure?
- **Exciting Adventure Hook**  
The first scene that draws heroes into action, and gives them the initial set of tasks to accomplish, leads to follow. 
- **[Escalating Challenges]**  
Multiple scenes here, one for each challenge the heroes need to overcome as they strive towards their goal.
- **Unexpected Complication**  
A more difficult challenge. Crisis, major setback, everything goes wrong? Villain makes a move? A surprising twist/reveal changes the direction of the story. Raise the stakes and threat level.
- **[More Challenges]**  
A few more challenge scenes. Heroes dealing with the consequences of the Complication and overcoming more obstacles on their path to the climax.
- **Awesome Climax**  
Final, most important/dangerous challenge that resolves the main conflict. Epic scene at a cool location.
- **Resolution**  
The aftermath. Possible outcomes/consequences of the adventure. How the secondary plot threads might resolve? How does the world (and heroes’ lives) change after the climax? 

This process is pretty straightforward, outlines tend to be similar between the adventures, and you already know everything you need to know to make it. Just write down the scene headings describing what's going on in your adventure.

## Summarize the Scenes
The next step is to create a short summary of the story. Under each scene heading, briefly (in 2-4 sentences) describe what happens in the scene. Imagine playing through the adventure as players, imagine running the story as the GM, write down things you wish to remember about the story.

For every scene, you want to make sure to mention 4 things:
 
 > **Scene Template**
- Location - where does the scene take place? 
- Characters - who will the heroes encounter there?
- Challenges - what challenge will they need to overcome?
- Clues - What important information will the players learn about the story? How does it lead them to the next scene?

Most of the time you will have one scene per challenge, and each scene will take place in it's own location.

Just like with the outline, this step tends to be pretty easy, because you already know almost everything that happens. It doesn't demand a lot of creaitvity - just summarize your ideas, tell yourself a story, and make sure it makes sense.

## List Open Questions
The process of outlining and summarizing the story almost always reveals a number of open questions - plot holes, inconsistencies, things you haven't thought about during the brainstorming phase, missing information, things left to figure out about the story.

That is perfectly normal and expected. Add the open questions you encounter to the list of Questions and Answers in your Brainstorming Template, add the things you'd like to improve to the ToDo list.

You can also just use placeholders. If you don't know the character's name, just write `[Orc Warrior's Name]`, if you don't know some details about the challenge the players are facing write `[Exciting Chase Scene]`.

When you encounter something you don't know - don't yet stop to figure it out, continue outlining and summarizing, write down all the things you **do** know about the story.

The goal is to quickly go through the outlining/summarizing process and quickly get an overview of the story, without ever getting stuck at a question you don't yet know how to answer.

**At the end of this process, you want to have a clear summary of everything you know about the story, and a list of specific questions that you still need to figure out.**

## Activity
- Write down a 2-4 sentence summary of your story.
- Write down the list of scene headings, one for each plot point and challenge.
- Write down 2-4 sentence summary of each scene. Where does the scene take place, who will the players encounter there, what challenges will they need to overcome?
- Write down the list of open questions you still need to figure out how to answer.

<!--
- Share the link to your summary in the `#outlining` channel.
- If you notice that you have some unsolved open questions that you need some help with - make a list of these questions and post them in the `#outlining` channel as well. (also on reddit?)
