Outline. One-page adventure template, write down JUST the scene headings.

## Scene Headings

## Summarize the Scenes
Writing the actual scenes. Summary descriptions. It's easy, you already know everything that happens. NO creativity there, just tell yourself a story, describe the characters, summarize what happens in every scene. 

## Open Questions
Imagine playing through the adventure. Write down the open questions.

## Activity
- Write down the list of scene headings, one for each plot point and challenge.
- Write down 1-3 sentence summary of each scene. Where does the scene take place, who will the players encounter there, what challenges will they need to overcome?
- Share the link to your summary in the `#outlining` channel.
- If you notice that you have some unsolved open questions that you need some help with - make a list of these questions and post them in the `#outlining` channel as well. (also on reddit?)
