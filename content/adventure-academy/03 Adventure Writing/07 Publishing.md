# Publishing
Finally your adventure is complete and you're ready to share it with the world!

There are many places where you can publish adventures, here are some of the best options:
- If you just want to share a free PDF of your adventure, the easiest way is to upload it to Dropbox or Google Drive and share the link with people.
- [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/) - the largest online store where people publish and buy adventures. Their UI is a bit inconvenient and archaic, but it's worth learning how to use it because they have a pretty large audience.
- [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) - an extremely easy and convenient way to build an online store where you can sell your adventures. They also enable you to grow an audience of email subscribers - once a person has bought (or downloaded for free) one of your adventures, you can send them email notifications about your future projects.
- [Itch.io](https://itch.io/) - another great website people use to share their games and adventures. It's mostly focused on video games, but I've seen it used for TTRPG adventures as well. I don't have a lot of experience with it, but it's worth being aware of it and trying it out.


## Marketing
Once your adventure is published, you want to share it with people. Begin by showing your adventure to your friends and sharing it on your social media.

If your adventure is free - you can share it on [/r/DMAcademy](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/) and [/r/DnDBehindTheScreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/).

Sharing your adventures on Reddit is one of the most effective ways to promote your work that I'm aware of - some of the adventures I wrote have gained thousands of upvotes and tens of thousands of views.

Note that these subreddits only allow you to share free resources (and even that - sparingly, and only as long as you actively participate in the community), but that's okay - creating and publishing free content will enable you to grow your audience and develop a community around your work.

You can create a discord server, a mailing list, or a Patreon account, and invite people who liked your adventures to join. Once you have an audience, you will be able to start publishing premium adventures and offering to sell them to your community.

Some people also have seem to have success with Facebook and Twitter. I'm not an expert in these platforms, but if you're using them actively you should try sharing your adventures there.
