# Writing Descriptions
Now that you have a solid summary and know exactly what happens in the story, it's time to create interesting and vivid descriptions that will make the players feel immersed in your story.

### Brevity
Keep the descriptions concise and simple. Long-winded descriptions will slow down the game, they're not very engaging, can't be interacted with, and difficult for the GM to memorize. Reading from the notes the descriptions of everything the players can see would be tedious, so most of the time descriptions will be improvised by the GM. 

Our goal is to paint a vivid picture in the GMs mind, so that when they're running the game for the players they could describe most things using their memory and improvisation skills. 

<!-- That's why I think it's better for us to learn writing descriptions from screenwriters rather than novelists.  -->

Don't wax poetics. It's better to point out a few remarkable details that stand out the most than to write a flowery wall of text.

Write as you speak. Picture yourself runnning the game for your friends, what would you say, how would you describe things?

### Focus on what matters
Use the text-box descriptions sparingly. Write them only for the most important scenes and characters. I recommend to prioritize the introduction the GM can read at the beginning of the adventure, the description of your antagonist, and the description of the set piece for the climax (but even these are optional).

### World seen through the Heroe's eyes
Describe things from the perspective of the players, imagine a camera looking through their eyes. Show don't tell. 

Try to get a detailed picture of the world around the players in your own imagination, and practice relaying what you see. It's also a great way to get better at describing things on the fly - describe what you see in your mind's eye in response to players' actions.

Focus on things the players would pay the most attention to - don't describe the intricate mosaic on the walls when there's a gigantic poison-dripping spider monster in the middle of the room.

Describe the world through the lense of the player character you're talking to - a horny barbarian, a paranoid thief, and a germaphobe wizard will notice different things when they walk into the bar.

If you don't know who the player characters will be when you write your adventure - that's okay, the rest of the advice still applies.

### Be specific
The most useful description writing tip I have learned is that you don't have to describe the laundry list of everything around the players, you just need a couple of extremely specific concrete details that will make the players feel immersed and evoke the experience you want.

On the spectrum between abstract and concrete, strive to make your language more concrete (while keeping it brief), it makes descriptions more vivid.

### Invoke all senses
A great way to make your descriptions more concrete is to include the details from all the senses, or focus on a single sense (not necessarily the vision). What do the players hear, see, and smell?

### Manage the Learning Curve
Don't throw a bunch of information (exposition, names, locations, concepts, etc.) at your readers/players at the same time - people will get bored, distracted, and start forgetting things. Reveal information in bits and pieces, as they become relevant.

### Learn from your favorite authors
Read and watch DnD shows. Pay attention to how your favorite authors and GMs describe things. Watch [Dimension 20](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC8zWIx8aBQme-x1nX9iZ0A) and [Critical Role](https://www.youtube.com/c/criticalrole), and try to emulate how Brennan and Matt describe their scenes.

### Describing characters
In addition to all of the tips above, you want to describe more than just the character's physical appearance. Describe their mannerisms, behaviors, expressions and emotions.

Does the character seem energetic or exhausted? Do they have an air of satisfaction in their work or are they just trying to get through the day? Are they looking at you kindly, menacingly, resentfully?

Describe how their speech sounds like, the tone and aspects (pitch, volume, etc.) of their voice.
