# Descriptions and Dialogue
Now that you have a solid summary and know exactly what happens in the story, it's time to add some artistry and create interesting and vivid descriptions that will immerse players in your story.

## Scene Descriptions
Long-winded descriptions will slow down the game, they're not very engaging, can't be interacted with, and difficult for the GM to memorize. Reading everything players see from the notes would be tedious, so most of the time the descriptions will be improvised by the GM. 

Our goal is to paint a vivid picture in the GMs mind, so that when they're running the game for the players they could describe most things using their memory and improvisation skills. That's why I think it's better for us to learn writing descriptions from screenwriters rather than novelists. 

With that in mind, here's some advice on creating some good desceiptions.

Write text-box descriptions only for the most important scenes and characters. I recommend to prioritize the intro that the GM can read at the beginning of the adventure, a description of your antagonist, and a description of the set piece for the climax.

Describe things from the perspective of the players, imagine a camera looking through their eyes. Focus on things the players would pay the most attention to - don't describe the intricate mosaic on the walls when there's a gigantic poison-dripping spider monster in the middle of the room.

Describe the world through the lense of the player character you're talking to - a horny barbarian, a paranoid thief, and a germaphobe wizard will notice different things when they walk into the bar.

Keep the descriptions concise and simple. It's better to point out a few remarkable details that stand out the most than to write a flowery wall of text.

Be specific. The most useful description writing tip I have learned is that you don't have to describe a laundry list of everything around the players, you just need a couple of extremely specific concrete details that will make players feel immersed and evoke the experience you want.
> [Vivid Settings Example]

Include the details from all the senses, or focus on one sense (not necessarily the vision). What do the players hear, see, and smell?

## Character Descriptions
Well, some characters will speak sometimes.
It cant hurt to be able to write exactly what they say.
Thats where clues and exposition can come in!
Imagine speaking as character.


## Dialogue
Fun flavorful details, jokes, interesting descriptions, metaphors - what would I say there? Defies description? Nah, I bet I can overanalyze this, or do away wih it. Picture yourself runnning the game with your friends, what would you say, how would you describe. Vivid descriptions, how do writers do this?
