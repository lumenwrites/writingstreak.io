# Main Characters
Now you need some characters to populate your story.

## Simplified Character Design
Many books have been written on how to design good characters and make them seem realistic. Luckily, for adventures, it doesn't need to be that complicated.

Here's what you need to know about your main characters:
- **Name**
- **Description** - Your character's appearance, mannerisms, speech patterns.
- **Personality** - Values, Ideals, Flaws, Opinions, Likes.
- **Occupation** - What do they do with their life?
- **Motivations** - What do they want? What do they fear?

Here are some optional things you may want to consider:
- Relationships - their Allies, Enemies, Social Status, Factions they belong to.
- Secrets they know.
- Unique Powers/Spells/Items.


The easiest way to come up with the physical appearance for a character is to find a well-suited illustration. Search websiets like [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/search?sort_by=likes&category_ids=65&medium_ids=1) and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=fantasy%20character%20design&rs=typed&term_meta[]=fantasy%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=character%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=design%7Ctyped) for things like "Fantasy Character Design", or visit [/r/ImaginaryLandscapes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryCharacters/top/). Sometimes you want to search for something more specific, like "Evil Voodoo Shaman". Having a picture of your character will instantly give you most of the information you need to vividly describe or roleplay them.

Personality is also easy - just take your favorite characters from TV and movies. To make your ideas more original you can:
> Reverse their key character traits:
- Creepy and evil Hermione.
- Shy and humble Joker.
- Compassionate and Loving Dr House.
- Well-meaning doofus Darth Vader who tries to do good but fails terribly.
> Apply personality to a character you wouldn't expect:
- The Supreme Holy Emperor with the personality of Homer Simpson.
- Humble Peasant with the personality of Walter White.
- Princess with the personality of Indiana Jones.
- Bartender with the personality of Spock.
- Paladin with the personality of Chandler Bing.

These methods make coming up with interesting characters very easy, and using a well known character or a celebrity as a reference (with some tweaks) makes it instantly obvious how to write and roleplay the character.

## Main Antagonist
Antagonist is the most important character by far, and they should be the most fleshed-out. That's where you should begin designing your cast.

They will be the main source of obstacles for players to overcome, their desires and goals will often drive the story forward (or cause it to happen in the first place), and they should probably be the most interesting NPC in your adventure.

In addition to the Simplified Character Design outlined above, for the antagonist you want to answer the following questions:
- What is their goal? Why do they pursue it? What horrible thing will happen if they succeed?
- What are the steps of their evil plan? How would it unfold if it was unopposed by the players? 
- How will the players learn about the plan, and what could they do to disrupt and ultimately ruin it? How will the villain respond to these disruptions? 
- What resources do they have to accomplish their goal, fight back against players, and get their plan back on track?

<!-- You can start with a goal ("Get Treasure") and then come up with an Antagonist ("Evil guy who wants to get it first"). Or you can start with an antagonist... -->

## Active Antagonist
 Making them active, thats how you prevent the game from being on the rails. You use your own intelligence to simulate the antagonist and respond to players actions.
Active antagonist = interactive non railroady adventure.
