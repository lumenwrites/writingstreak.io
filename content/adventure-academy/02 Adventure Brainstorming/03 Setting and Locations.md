# Setting and Locations
The next step is to figure out where your adventure is going to take place, and come up with a bunch of fun locations.

## Unique Setting
Coming up with a setting is pretty straightforward - think about the most fun place for your adventure. 

I recommend trying to stay away from the generic settings ("fantasy town", "magic forest", "small village") - try to add an interesting twist to your setting, come up with something that makes it unique.

One good way to do that is to think about settings you don't normally see in the adventures, or settings you really like, or unusual biomes.

Apply the same principles you have learned in the lesson on generating ideas - combine things that are not usually combined, reverse or exaggerate ideas, swap the concrete elements for something else.

> 
- Exotic settings: 
	- "Egyptian Pyramids" is better than "Typical Fantasy City".
	- "Amazon Tribe Village", or a "Cliff-side Village" is better than "Generic Medieval Fantasy Village".
	- "Fantasy Subway" is better than "Sewers Under the City".
- Reverse the element:
	- Egypt is hot => Ice-Covered Egyptian Pyramids
	- Pyramids are ancient => Pyramids are just in the process of being built.
	- Pyramids are low-tech => Alien high-tech steel Pyramids.
- Replace the element:
	- Pyramid is filled with Mummies => Egyptian Vampires.
	- Pyramid is a place to store dead Pharaoh => It is a Factory, or a Magic School.
- Exaggerate the element: 
	- Mountain-sized Pyramids.
	- A world where everyone has their own Pyramid.
	
Another great way to make a setting unique is to fill it with interesting inhabitants.

>
- Typical fantasy village inhabited by Kobolds or Zombies. 
- Typical fantasy city inhabited by Professional Assassins.
- Typical fantasy dungeon inhabited by Scientists and Scholars.

And, of course, you can combine both methods to make both the setting and it's i habitants unique and interesting.

Finally, what I actually do in practice most of the time - just browse [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/search?sort_by=likes&category_ids=5&medium_ids=1), or search [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=Fantasy%20Environment%20Design&rs=typed&term_meta[]=Fantasy%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=Environment%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=Design%7Ctyped) for things like "Fantasy Environment Design", or browse the [Imaginary Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryLandscapes/top/?sort=top&t=all) subreddits, and use a setting inspired by one of the images. You can find my collection of fun environments [here](https://www.artstation.com/lumenwrites/collections/119125).

## Locations
Think about the specific locations your players will visit.

The most important location is the one where Climax is going to take place - you want some epic, dramatic, and memorable set piece. 

> If our adventure takes place in the Pyramids, some good climax locations would be:
- Top of the Pyramid.
- Pharaoh's Tomb with the Cursed Sarcophagus.
- Secret Chamber filled with Snakes.

You also want to figure out the location where the adevnture begins, and 3-5 interesting places inbetween. Just picture your setting, and think about the most interesting and remarkable places you'd like your players to visit.

## Locations as Antagonists
One great way to make locations more interesting is to think about the environmental threats and dangers the players may find in the location. That turns the location from a pretty backdrop into an active part of the story that requires some creativity to deal with.

> Locations as Antagonists
- Icy tundra where you must find heat to survive.
- River of lava you must find a way to cross.
- Crumbling temple you must escape.
