# Intriguing Mysteries
A good mystery can make any adventure more fun, engaging, and serve as the primary motivation for the players. A mystery will drive players forward, and help you to reveal information about the story in an exciting way (as opposed to boring players with exposition). Unlike intricate murder mysteries, simple mysteries are relatively easy to do, so there's no reason not to add a mystery element to all of your adventures.

The trick to creating a mystery is to **hide the key information about the story**, instead of just offering it to players on a silver platter. Instead of just using an NPCs to explain to players everything they need to know at the beginning of the adventure, you can make them wonder about what's going on, search for clues, work to reveal the truth, make guesses and try to solve mystery on their own.

**Reveal information through clues, use the clues to lead players through the story.** Use clues and inforamtion as a reward for completing the challenges. Make players work to discover the clues, reward them by revealing more about the story.

Picture your challenges as rooms in a dungeon, and clues as doors leading players to different rooms. Clues unlock the scenes, encounters, interactions, enable the players to progress through the story. 

> **Examples of Clues**:
- The Secrets some characters know. Players can overhear rumors, interrogate witnesses, intimidate Evil Minions into revealing the information.
- Research. Players can find information in ancient books, mysterious notes, journals, maps.
- Physical clues. Dagger with a unique sigil left at the crime scene, tracks leading into the forest, secret doors.
- Spying. Players can track some of the characters, listen in on conversations, infiltrate private parties.
- Magic - divination spells, talking to ghosts, magical surveillance, mind reading.

To make sure that players will be able to make progress through your adventure - make multiple clues for each important conclusion you need the players to arrive to. A good rule of thumb is to give players 3 possible ways to find out any key bit of information.

Ask yourself:
- What interesting information about this story can I hide instead of revealing it right away?
- What are some ways the players could find out about this information?
- How can the players obtain these clues?
- To what scenes does the clue lead, which locations, encounters, or conversations does it unlock? 
- What actions does the clue encourage players to take?

Use the clues to connect the scenes together, direct them from one scene to the next.

But don't overdo it, unless you're writing an adventure specifically focused on mystery - keep it simple. Elaborate mysteries can be really difficult to write, but adding a few small mystery elements to your story is an easy way to make it much better.
