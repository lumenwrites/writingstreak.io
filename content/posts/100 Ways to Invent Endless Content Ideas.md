<h1 className="h1-header orange">Ways to Invent Endless Content Ideas</h1>

This is my collection of ways to come up with an unlimited number of ideas for your blog posts, youtube videos, podcast episodes, articles, and so on.

### Project-based ideas
Work on interesting projects, pursue challenging goals, solve problems and overcome obstacles on your path. This inevitably leads to original insights and epiphanies you can share with people.

### Learn by teaching
You don't have to be an expert to teach - study a subject you're interested in, try to develop a skill, keep notes, and share everything you're learning. If the ideas you're learning are useful to you, they will be useful to other people.

### Organize your notes
I keep a file where I write down any useful ideas that occur to me, anything I have learned, read, or want to remember. When I want to write - I don't have to invent anything on the spot, I can just organize my old notes. If I found an idea insightful enough to write down, it's probably worth sharing.

### Research-based ideas
Pick a topic you're interested in and do research - read wiki articles, blog posts, forum threads, watch youtube videos. Write down the most useful and insightful ideas, compile them into a summary post, add links to the original sources at the end.

### Reading-based ideas
Read books, watch video courses, listen to podcasts. Write down the most interesting ideas, organize them into [Evergreen Atomic Posts](/post/evergreen-atomic-posts), combine these posts into longer articles.

### ELI5 complicated subjects
Take an idea that's difficult to understand (or is very dry and boring to read) and make it accessible, concise, engaging, easy to understand, fun to read.

### Make connections
Develop an expertise in different areas that aren't usually connected, and find ways to [value arbitrage](/post/value-arbitrage) between them - make interesting associations, apply useful ideas from one field to another. For example, my post on [how writing is similar to startups](/post/writing-like-product). Another example - browsing popular tutorials made for the Unity game engine, and adapting them to a different engine like Godot.

### Copy what already works
Find the most popular blogs, subreddits, and youtube channels in your niche. Browse their most popular posts (use the [Moz Link Explorer](https://analytics.moz.com/pro/link-explorer/top-pages) tool to find the most popular pages on a website) and their most popular videos (sort the youtube channel's videos or search results by the number of views). Write your own take on these ideas. Combine several sources about the same subject, extract the most useful patterns, summarize best ideas. 

### Target novice people
Think about the difference between you and the version of yourself from 10 years ago. What are the most important things you'd like to tell yourself? How would you help yourself to learn what you know now, what are some things you wish you'd learn sooner, what are some common mistakes and pitfalls to avoid?

Target a general audience - what aspects of the topic you're an expert in could you make interesting and accessible to a layman?

### Answer Questions
Help people in communities. Go to Discord servers, subreddits, forums in your niche, StackExchange sites, and see what problems people are dealing with. Answer their questions (using your own expertise or research). Every answer is worthy of sharing.

Keep a list of your own questions you're confused about, things you would like to learn, concepts you don't understand, problems you're facing. Make posts on subreddits, forums, and discord communities, ask people for help. Every time you find a solution - summarize the most useful replies, or explain what you figured out on your own.

### Build in public
Work on something cool, share your progress. Game developers create devlogs about the projects they're working on, see if you can apply something like that to your own niche. 

### Surface valuable information
Find information that isn't already popular and well known - obscure books, boring studies, old, forgotten, and controversial ideas. Mine the already discovered information, find gems, make them popular and easily discoverable.

Teach what you're learning from the sources not easily accessible to others (like a very expensive online course, or the things you learn at your uni).

### New and rapidly evolving niches
Be on the cutting edge of a rapidly changing field (like software) where new ideas/frameworks/tools appear every month. Research them, find better ways to use them, teach them. Or have extremely niche interests/hobbies where there are many low-hanging-fruit ideas that are easy to discover even for a non-expert. Discover new things to be interested in that don't have a lot written about them.

### Keep the Snippets file
If you're a programmer or a technical writer - keep the file of useful code snippets. Notice when you're googling the same subject multiple times, or finding yourself copy-pasting similar code over and over again. Organize the related snippets into a post.

### Interview people
Find people who are more experienced or successful than you, send them cold emails or tweets, ask if they would like to do an interview and answer some questions.

This will be easier to do when your blog/channel/podcast becomes somewhat popular, because then you are offering people to share their ideas with a larger audience, which is more appealing.

While your audience is small - you can talk to your peers, bloggers, people you met on social media, anyone on your level who's worth learning from. Normal people often appreciate if you invite them to an interview and ask them questions about their area of expertise.

### Industry news
Do a summary of the most important things that happened in your niche during the last week or month. New cool features in your game engine, new cool startups that have been launched, new research papers that have been published.

Some good examples - [GameFromScratch](https://www.youtube.com/c/gamefromscratch/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) makes videos about the news in gamedev industry, [TwoMinutePapers](https://www.youtube.com/c/K%C3%A1rolyZsolnai/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) summarizes the new and exciting AI research papers.

### Analysis
Take an already existing and successful product and explain how it's been made, what makes it successful. [Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/c/everyframeapainting) makes video essays analyzing movies, [Game Maker's Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkBrownGMT/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) analyze the mechanics of popular games.
