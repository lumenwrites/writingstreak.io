# How to Come Up With Startup Ideas
This is my collection of notes on inventing startup ideas.

You can't invent the idea by brute force, just by thinking real hard. You can live the kind of life that leads to ideas, and makes you into the kind of person who has ideas:
- Learn things so you can see opportunities. Read.
- Learn tools so that you have more problem-solving powers.
- Listen to indie hackers and browse show hn and producthunt, so that you see many examples of ideas (building a library), see what you can improve or copy.
- Build things. When you dont have a brilliant idea, focus on building whatever idea you have, if you have none build copies.

Learn to identify problems.
(cutting edge of rapidly changing field, cross-applying domains).
solve a problem. get person from a to b.

Sell to businesses, not consumers. Businesses have much more money, are easier to sell to at higher prices (it's easier 100 things for $100 than it is to sell 1000 things for $10), and are more willing to spend the money. Value prop is also clearer - if your $50 product can save (or make) extra $100 to the business, buying it is a no-brainer. 

Generally, it's much easier to sell something that makes money or saves money/time. The richer your target audience is, the easier it is make/save them a lot of money.

>> 
What will the businesses buy? Look at the things they already buy (person's time, other solutions), and ask - which of those would be transformatively better if I applied my own unique skills to it?
>> Dont worry that someone is already solving the product, looking at what people are already making is the best way to find a valuable problem you can contribute to.
You happily pay a dentist money even though he didnt invent dentistry, dentist makes quite a good living doing what every other dentist does. At the scale of an i die hacker (where extra $1-2k is life changinf for you), you dont have to be the only person in the world executing on this idea.
Economy is massive, businesses have more money than you can imagine, its easily possible for 100 people ro make good money in backup industry (but doesnt winner take all?)
Finding customers is a part of the idea stage, great idea without a plan on how to get in front of people is not a great idea.
will your job buy it?
cold email it to people who should be using it. would you beta test it for a month and if it works out would you pay $50/mo?
Go to people who sell so ething complimentary/similar/duplicative to yours, ask them who they dont sell to, ask for refereals.

[AI Study Guide](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bjjbp5i5G8bekJuxv/study-guide)
Problems-we-don’t-understand rely heavily on bringing in frames and tools from other fields. (If the frames and tools of this field were already sufficient, it wouldn’t be a problem-we-don’t-understand in the first place.) So, you want to have a very large library of frames and tools to apply.

Bringing in frames and tools from other fields requires the ability to recognize and adapt those frames and tools for problems very different from the field in which we first learned them. So, practice generalizing concepts from one area to another is particularly important.

Practice Generalizing Concepts

Keeping a list of 10-20 hard problems in the back of your mind, and trying out each new frame or tool on one of those problems, is a particularly useful technique to practice generalization.

areas which advertise extreme generality, but are rarely useful in practice. it’s useful to look for frames/tools which are at least useful for _something_. Keeping a list of 10-20 hard problems in the back of your mind is one useful test for this. 

“be able to model anything”: if there’s some system or phenomenon which you’re not sure how to model, even in principle, and field X has good tools for modelling it, then study field X. our intuitions for a problem of interest often come from other systems, and you never know what system will seem like a useful analogue. If we can model anything, then we always know how to formalize a model based on any particular analogy

Study **a lot**. 
> when I trace the sources of my key thoughts on alignment and agency, they come from an awful lot of places.

The more you cover, the wider the range of ideas you’ll have to draw from.
 the importance of actually playing around with all the frames and tools and trying them out on problems of your own. See how they carry over to new applications; see how to use them.

practice writing clear explanations and distillations of technical ideas.

[Epistemic Minor Leagues](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/epistemic-minor-leagues)
- Have super niche interests/hobbies where there are still things left to be discovered.
- Have expertise in different overlapping areas that aren't usually connected, and make associations, apply ideas from one area to another, value arbitrage.
- Mine already discovered information, find gems, make them popular/discoverable.
- Take complicated subjects and explain them in an engaging and easy to understand way.
- Be on a cutting edge of a rapidly changing field (like software) where there's new ideas/frameworks/tools every month, which you can research, find better ways to use, teach.
- Work on your own projects/startups. Become an expert in this specific niche/problem/customer. Invent insights on how to build a better product, solve the problem better, satisfy the need.
- Answering questions on stackoverflow and reddit. Use your expertise to find an answer to someone's extremely specific problem. Just solve extremely niche, concrete, specific problems and help people out using your expertise. 
- Writing fiction. Make up a world diversed from reality, running on whatever rules you came up with, and generate insight porn based on this world. Discover how to solve Harry's problem or a new way to apply Taylor's superpower.



> someone's ability to generate new ideas is at least in part driven by one's ability to make links between things that are not linked or very distantly so.

Browse Product Hunt, Clone/Recombine/Improve people's peojects.
The thing that annoys me about webdev is that I dont have app ideas. Why? Because to have original web app ideas, you need to face problems you can solve with web apps. I cared about writing, hence wst and nulis and blogging platforms. I cared about making money with godot, hence asset marketplace.
If you dont have a problem solvable with a webapp, you won't have original ideas.
Which might be just fine, if you can competently clone other people's projects that already work, and make money doing that.
Which services am I already paying for? Sell that.
I was about to pay for analytics. Maybe I can make my own. Their project is open source, copy it.
Browse show hn and product hunt weekly posts, find a thing you can copy, copy it.
Talk to people and see which solvable problems they have.
Or find an app with a great idea they didnt max out for some reason. 
Thats how you get ideas if you dont have your own.
If this helps me make money doing what I love - Ill take it.
