<h1 className="h1-header orange">Format your writing for Readability</h1>

### Divide things into small chunks
Nobody likes walls of text.

-   Split your post into sections, use headings to make them skimmable.
-   For very long posts, split your sections into subsections.
-   Split your paragraphs into smaller paragraphs.
-   Use bulleted lists when possible.

> People are much happier to read a long thing if they can be tricked into thinking it’s a series of small things.

Small sections are easy to read, easy to remember, and finishing each one gives readers a satisfying sense of accomplishment.

### Add variety
People get bored when they focus on the same thing for too long.

**Break up the monotony** - vary the sentence and paragraph lengths to create rhythm, use illustrations, diagrams, links, and quotes. **Bold** or _italicize_ some words to simulate intonation.

**Vary the tone and types of content**: explain an abstract concept, give an interesting concrete example, discuss a case study, make a silly joke, use a metaphor, ask a question, address a counterargument, tell a story.

### Make ideas flow into each other
The purpose of each sentence is to get people to read the next sentence. Use words like _“and”_, _“so”_, _“therefore”_, _“for example”_, _“but”_, _“also”_ to connect the paragraphs and prompt people to continue reading. For example:

> _It’s pretty obvious that X is true, and we have lots of evidence for this: First, [A]. Second, [B]. Third, [C]._
> 
> _Now, some people say X, but that’s wrong. It only looks like X, because Y. And yet,_ we continue to Z_, for example R. So_, what you need is…

### Read your post aloud
And remove everything that’s difficult to read, makes you stumble, or doesn’t sound like something you’d say in a conversation.
