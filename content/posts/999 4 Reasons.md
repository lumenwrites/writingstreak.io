# Typography and Design Test

**Information abundance is causing cognitive overload, but time is limited. Curation of content helps Twitterers manage their information intake.**

Only recently I realised I needed to start treating Twitter seriously. Countless stories of people building audience rapidly, providing solutions and making strong financial gains. Yet the **amount of great content can feel overwhelming**. In my case, after 53 atomic essays and 40 days immersion in Twitter, I was tired. Took 24 hours “shore leave” to process.

> Be selective, avoid "shiny object syndrome”

Why should we follow curators? Aren't they gaining their followers by proxy, based on
the work of others? *It's OK if their work is useful*. **Which curators we can learn best from?** And how can we **apply these learnings** effectively? Which curators are going at the right pace for you? Experiment. Experience brings discernment.

## 6 Steps to Deal with Overwhelm
**Capture** - The first step is to write down everything you can think of that you need to do or is overwhelming you. Much of your overwhelm is simply keeping it all in your head. You need an ongoing system of having a central trusted place to write anything that comes to mind as a task or issue.

**Eliminate** - Take a look at everything you feel you need to do. Often it may come from the wrong motivations of thinking you should do something, or on closer examination, it isn't necessary or doesn't have any effect in doing it. Do you need to read all those emails in your inbox? Or can you archive them all and start again.

**Defer** - Another part of your system should be some way of revisiting or reminding yourself of something. Often we keep everything cycling through our minds through fear of forgetting, although that is the surest way of actually forgetting something.


## The Source of Friction
Fear feeds on countless insecurities. It once served to
protect but now endangers with inaction. Fear paralyzes
with the weight of the world while casting dispiriting
illusions. It is the chief enemy of getting started.

#### You know its many names...

- *Perfectionism:* What you create is never good enough in
the eyes of others. It must be better. You must be better.
Appearing weak or vulnerable will be the end of you and
your work.
- *Impostor Syndrome:* You aren't good enough. Publishing
your work is pointless. You won't make any progress. You
will be exposed as a fraud... a charlatan!
- *Procrastination:* You aren't quite ready to start. The time
isn't right. Conditions aren't favorable. Starting now
would be premature.
- *Insecurity:* Everyone will judge you. They always do. And
you will be found lacking!


## Put your notebook away. Turn off your laptop.
Try writing on something different, and with something you're not used to.

#### 1. Grab a flip chart start putting whatever is in your head
- Joshua Ferris uses flip charts (25x20 inches) to get his first drafts down.
- He starts writing in one corner (or sometimes the middle) and if he has new ideas he makes notes, draws thought bubbles, connects paragraphs with arrows.
- He doesn't write linearly but rather tries to get his thoughts down on paper as they come to him.

#### 2. Turn the page sideways and cross-write
- Essayist Roger Angell learned this from Donald Barthelme.
- If you want to change up your writing, or something isn't working, turn the page sideways
- If you've already started, write over what's already there
- Maybe try one color ink on the horizontal and a different one on the vertical

#### 3. Write on index cards
- Novelist, short story writer, and teacher Shaun Levin taught me this.
- Start filling index cards ... writing as big or small as you like. You might only put one word on a card. You might try to tell a whole story on another.
- He also recommends trying a different journal. Trade in that Moleskine for a reporters notebook. Or maybe a steno pad.

> You can always come back to the tried and true.

Maybe you'll hate that steno pad. Maybe you'll start carrying a flip chart and an easel with you on the bus.

Really in love with that Moleskine? Start writing in it with a Dry Erase pen. Or some crayons. Or a stub of a pencil you nicked from somebody's golf bag.

Play until the words come. Then just keep writing.
