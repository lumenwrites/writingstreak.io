# Pirates and Parrots  
## Summary

The Dread Pirate Mont Blanc was just defeated in battle by HMAS Valiant, and now the players are Fera Ley’s last hope to keep her freedom.

## Mont Blanc’s Battle
The party meets up in the Buccaneer's Arms (the local Tavern). The Mayor of Fera Ley, a portly fellow named Richard Dullen runs into the tavern gasping and panting. “Mont Blanc has been defeated!” Everyone leaves the tavern and can see in the skies just off the island the end of a battle and Mont Blanc’s ship, the Stuart’s Satisfaction, going down in flames as boarding lines are being cut.

## Pirates and Parrots

In the crowd, they meet Giotto Turtleton:

## Giotto Turtleton
Anthropomorphic Turtle wearing a spiffy hat. An extremely grumpy, old, cunning,  and experienced pirate-alchemist. 

</CharacterBox>

Their only chance at saving the island is to sneak on board of Valiant, rescue Mont Blanc, and capture the ship to make it a part of the pirate fleet.

Giotto gives players the shrinking potions, which enable them to shrink to roughly 3 inches tall, and, under the cover of night, fly their parrots to Valiant. Along the way they are attacked by a hungry osprey, and must defend themselves and their parrots.

## Infiltration

The pirates land on the ship and revert to their normal size. They have to dodge or confront the marines aboard the ship, and encounter the Quartermaster, Victor Van Boom. Victor is crooked, and can be bribed (or threatened) to show the party the way to Mont Blanc and his crew in the jail cell.

## Jailbreak

Mont Blanc and the crew are in jail. The lock can be picked, or Victor can unlock the door. Their weapons are in the weaponry nearby, guarded by two paladins. Once the pirates are out, they will help the party to take over the ship. Meanwhile, Valiant is close enough to the island to attack.

On their way to the captain’s cabin, the pirates must bypass the squadron of Navy soldiers. They can cause a distraction, or stealth their way through by crawling on the outside of the ship’s hull.

## Angel of Death
In the middle of the ship there’s a captain’s cabin.

## Viva Morrow, the Angel of Death
Captain of the Valiant. Can be played as a paladin or equivalent. Has Iron Wings that deploy to fly her to safety in the event of going overboard. 

</CharacterBox>

Once the pirates get too close, Captain Morrow steers the ship in the direction of Fera Ley and then breaks the navigational system. As the players fight her and her crew, they must fix the ship before it crashes into the island, killing everyone in town and on board. The captain’s cabin contains the engineering blueprints which can be used to fix the ship, if players can get past Viva and her fierce attacks.

## Resolution

The Empire is repelled, Fera Ley’s freedom is restored. Now, with HMAS Valiant in their navy, they’re able to defend themselves against the Empire. The age of pirates continues. For now...
