### Teach as you learn
- Study a subject you're interested in
- Share everything you're learning
>>
Teach as you learn
You don't have to be an expert to teach - study a subject you're interested in, try to develop a skill, keep notes, and share everything you're learning. If the ideas you're learning are useful to you, they will be useful to other people.
====
### Organize your notes
- Keep notes
- Write down all useful ideas you encounter
- Organize your notes into a post
>>
Organize your notes  
I keep a file where I write down any useful ideas that occur to me, anything I have learned or want to remember. When I want to write - I don't have to invent anything on the spot, I can just organize my old notes. If I found an idea insightful enough to write down, it's probably worth sharing.
====
### Research-based ideas
- Pick a topic you're interested in
- Do research:
  - Wiki articles
  - Blog posts
  - Forum threads
  - Youtube videos
- Compile and summarize the most useful ideas

### Create content for beginners
- Imagine talking to the younger version of yourself.

- What are some things you wish you'd learn sooner?
- What are some common mistakes and pitfalls to avoid?
>>
Write content for beginners.  
Think about the difference between you now, and the version of yourself from 10 years ago. What are the most important things you'd like to tell yourself?
How would you help yourself to learn what you know now?

What are some common mistakes and pitfalls you wish you could avoid?
====

>>
Keep the list of your own questions you're confused about, things you would like to learn, concepts you don't understand, and the problems you're facing.

====
### Build in public
- Work on something cool
- Share your progress
>>
Build in public  
Work on something cool, and share your progress. Game developers create devlogs about the projects they're working on, see if you can apply something like that to your own niche. 
====
### Surface valuable information
- Mine already discovered information
- Find gems, ideas most people haven't heard of
- Make them accessible and easy to discover
>>
Surface valuable information  
Find information that isn't already popular and well known - obscure books, boring studies, old, forgotten, and controversial ideas. Mine the already discovered information, find gems, make them popular and easily discoverable.
====
### Inaccessible Sources
Use the sources not easily accessible to others:
- Expensive online courses
- Things you learn at your uni
- Things only available in your language

Teach what you're learning from the sources not easily accessible to others (like a very expensive online course, or the things you learn at your uni).

Be on the cutting edge of new and rapidly evolving fields, like web development, machine learning, game development, or digital art.

====
### Niche interests and hobbies
- Develop extremely niche interests/hobbies
- Participate in small but passionate communities
- Find low-hanging-fruit ideas
- Share your discoveries
>> 
You can also have extremely niche interests, weird hobbies, and participate in small but passionate communities. Small niches have low hanging fruit ideas that are easy to discover even for a non expert. Find new interests that don't have a lot written about them, then share what you've discovered.
====
### Keep the Snippets file
- Keep the file of useful code snippets
- Organize the related snippets into a post
>>
Keep the Snippets file  
If you're a programmer or a technical writer - keep the file where you collect the useful code snippets. Notice when you're googling the same subject multiple times, or finding yourself copy-pasting similar code over and over again. Organize the related snippets into a post.
====
### Interview people
- Reach out to experienced and successful people
- Invite them to do an interview
>>
Interview people  
Find people who are more experienced or successful than you, send them cold emails or tweets, ask if they would like to do an interview and answer some questions.
This will be easier to do when your blog or podcast becomes somewhat popular, because then you are offering people to share their ideas with a larger audience, which is more appealing.
While your audience is small - you can talk to your peers, bloggers, people you met on social media, anyone on your level who's worth learning from. Normal people often appreciate if you invite them to an interview and ask them questions about their area of expertise.
====
### Analysis
