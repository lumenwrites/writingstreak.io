This is my collection of ways to come up with an unlimited number of ideas for your youtube videos, blog posts, podcast episodes, articles, and so on.

Project-based ideas
Work on interesting projects, pursue challenging goals, solve problems and overcome obstacles on your path. This inevitably leads to original insights and epiphanies you can share with people.

Learn by teaching
You don't have to be an expert to teach - study a subject you're interested in, try to develop a skill, keep notes, and share everything you're learning. If the ideas you're learning are useful to you, they will be useful to other people.

Organize your notes
I keep a file where I write down any useful ideas that occur to me, anything I have learned or want to remember. When I want to write - I don't have to invent anything on the spot, I can just organize my old notes. If I found an idea insightful enough to write down, it's probably worth sharing.

Research-based ideas
Pick a topic you're interested in, and do research - read wiki articles, blog posts, forum threads, and watch youtube videos. Write down the most insightful ideas, and compile them into a summary post.
	
Ideas based on reading
Read books, watch video courses, listen to podcasts. Write down the most interesting ideas in your own words, and organize them by subject. Then - combine the most useful takeaways from multiple sources, and share them.

Explain complicated subjects
Take an idea that's difficult to understand (or is very dry and boring) and make it accessible, concise, engaging, and fun to read.

Make connections
Develop an expertise in different areas that aren't usually connected, and find ways to apply useful ideas from one field to another.

Find what already works, and copy it.
Find the most popular blogs, subreddits, and youtube channels in your niche. Browse their most popular posts and videos. Then - create your own take on these ideas. Combine several sources on the same subject, extract the most useful patterns, summarize best ideas, and share them.
	
Write content for beginners.
Think about the difference between you now, and the version of yourself from 10 years ago. What are the most important things you'd like to tell yourself?

How would you help yourself to learn what you know now?
What are some things you wish you'd learn sooner?
What are some common mistakes and pitfalls you wish you could avoid?

Target a general audience.
Are there any aspects of the topic you are interested in that you could make accessible to a layman? Explain what you find interesting about those things, and get other people excited about them.
	
Answer Questions.
Help people in communities. Go to Discord servers, subreddits, forums in your niche, StackExchange sites, and see what problems people are dealing with. Answer their questions (using your own expertise or research). Share your answers with your audience.
	
Keep the list of your own questions you're confused about, things you would like to learn, concepts you don't understand, and the problems you're facing. Make posts in communities, and ask people for help. Every time you find a solution - summarize the most useful replies, or explain what you figured out on your own.

Build in public
Work on something cool, and share your progress. Game developers create devlogs about the projects they're working on, see if you can apply something like that to your own niche. 

Surface valuable information
Find information that isn't already popular and well known - obscure books, boring studies, old, forgotten, and controversial ideas. Mine the already discovered information, find gems, make them popular and easily discoverable.

Teach what you're learning from the sources not easily accessible to others (like a very expensive online course, or the things you learn at your uni).
	
Be on the cutting edge of new and rapidly evolving fields, like web development, machine learning, game development, or digital art. These fields change rapidly, new ideas, frameworks, and tools appear every month. You can research them, discover better ways to use them, or just help other people to stay up to date.

You can also have extremely niche interests, weird hobbies, and participate in small but passionate communities. Small niches have low hanging fruit ideas that are easy to discover even for a non expert. Find new interests that don't have a lot written about them, then share what you've discovered.

Keep the Snippets file
If you're a programmer or a technical writer - keep the file where you collect the useful code snippets. Notice when you're googling the same subject multiple times, or finding yourself copy-pasting similar code over and over again. Organize the related snippets into a post.

Interview people
Find people who are more experienced or successful than you, send them cold emails or tweets, ask if they would like to do an interview and answer some questions.

This will be easier to do when your blog or podcast becomes somewhat popular, because then you are offering people to share their ideas with a larger audience, which is more appealing.

While your audience is small - you can talk to your peers, bloggers, people you met on social media, anyone on your level who's worth learning from. Normal people often appreciate if you invite them to an interview and ask them questions about their area of expertise.

Analyze already successful products
Take an already existing and successful product and explain how it's been made, and what makes it successful.

Share the industry news
Do a summary of the most important things that happened in your niche during the last week or month. New cool features in your game engine, new cool startups that have been launched, new research papers that have been published. Help people to stay on top of the important events and developments.
