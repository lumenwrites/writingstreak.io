# Invent Endless <br/> Content Ideas
>>
This is my collection of ways to come up with an unlimited number of ideas for your blog posts, youtube videos, podcast episodes, articles, and so on.
---
## Project-based ideas
- Work on interesting projects.
- Overcome obstacles on your path.
- Share your solutions with people.
>> Work on interesting projects, pursue challenging goals, solve problems and overcome obstacles on your path. This inevitably leads to original insights and epiphanies you can share with people.
---
### Learn by teaching
- Study a subject you're interested in.
- Share everything you're learning.
>>
You don't have to be an expert to teach - study a subject you're interested in, try to develop a skill, keep notes, and share everything you're learning. If the ideas you're learning are useful to you, they will be useful to other people.
---
### Organize your notes
- Keep a notes file where you keep your notes.
- Write down any useful ideas you have, learn,  
or want to remember.
- Organize your notes into a post.
>>
I keep a file where I write down any useful ideas that occur to me, anything I have learned, read, or want to remember. When I want to write - I don't have to invent anything on the spot, I can just organize my old notes. If I found an idea insightful enough to write down, it's probably worth sharing.
---
### Research-based ideas
- Pick a topic you're interested in.
- Do research:
  - Wiki articles
  - Blog posts
  - Forum threads
  - Youtube videos
- Compile and summarize the most useful ideas.
>>
Pick a topic you're interested in and do research - read wiki articles, blog posts, forum threads, watch youtube videos. Write down the most useful and insightful ideas, compile them into a summary post, add links to the original sources at the end.
---
### Reading-based ideas
- Read books, watch video courses, listen to podcasts.
- Take good notes, organize them into posts.
>>
Read books, watch video courses, listen to podcasts. Write down the most interesting ideas, organize them into notes, combine these posts into longer articles.
---
### ELI5 complicated subjects
- Take ideas that are boring, technical, hard to understand.
- Make them accessible, concise, engaging, fun to read.
>>
Take an idea that's difficult to understand (or is very dry and boring to read) and make it accessible, concise, engaging, easy to understand, fun to read.
---
### Make connections
- Develop an expertise in different areas.
- Apply useful ideas from one field to another.
>>
Develop an expertise in different areas that aren't usually connected, and find ways to apply useful ideas from one field to another. For example - browsing popular tutorials made for the Unity game engine, and adapting them to a different engine like Godot.
---
### Copy what already works
- Find the most popular blogs, subreddits, and youtube channels.
- Browse their most popular posts or videos.
- Share your own take, or summarize the best ideas.
>>
Find the most popular blogs, subreddits, and youtube channels in your niche. Browse their most popular posts (use the [Moz Link Explorer](https://analytics.moz.com/pro/link-explorer/top-pages) tool to find the most popular pages on a website) and their most popular videos (sort the youtube channel's videos or search results by the number of views). Write your own take on these ideas. Combine several sources about the same subject, extract the most useful patterns, summarize best ideas. 
---
### Target novice people
- Imagine talking to the version of yourself from 10 years ago.
- What are the most important things you'd like to tell yourself?
- How would you help yourself to learn what you know now?
- What are some things you wish you'd learn sooner?
- What are some common mistakes and pitfalls to avoid?
>>
Think about the difference between you and the version of yourself from 10 years ago. What are the most important things you'd like to tell yourself? How would you help yourself to learn what you know now, what are some things you wish you'd learn sooner, what are some common mistakes and pitfalls to avoid?
---
### Target a general audience
- Can you make your niche interesting and accessible to a layman?
>>
Target a general audience - what aspects of the topic you're an expert in could you make interesting and accessible to a layman?
---
### Answer Questions
- Help people in communities, answer their questions.
- Keep a list of your own questions, ask for help in communities.
- Share the answers you find, summarize most useful replies.
>>
Help people in communities. Go to Discord servers, subreddits, forums in your niche, StackExchange sites, and see what problems people are dealing with. Answer their questions (using your own expertise or research). Every answer is worthy of sharing.
-
Keep a list of your own questions you're confused about, things you would like to learn, concepts you don't understand, problems you're facing. Make posts on subreddits, forums, and discord communities, ask people for help. Every time you find a solution - summarize the most useful replies, or explain what you figured out on your own.
---
### Build in public
- Work on something cool.
- Share your progress.
>>
Work on something cool, share your progress. Game developers create devlogs about the projects they're working on, see if you can apply something like that to your own niche. 
---
### Surface valuable information
- Mine already discovered information.
- Use the sources not easily accessible to others.
- Find gems, ideas most people haven't heard of.
- Make them accessible and easy to discover.
>>
Find information that isn't already popular and well known - obscure books, boring studies, old, forgotten, and controversial ideas. Mine the already discovered information, find gems, make them popular and easily discoverable.
-
Teach what you're learning from the sources not easily accessible to others (like a very expensive online course, or the things you learn at your uni).
---
### New and rapidly evolving niches
- Be on the cutting edge of a rapidly changing field.
- Develop extremely niche interests/hobbies.
- Share your discoveries about them.
>>
Be on the cutting edge of a rapidly changing field (like software) where new ideas/frameworks/tools appear every month. Research them, find better ways to use them, teach them. Or have extremely niche interests/hobbies where there are many low-hanging-fruit ideas that are easy to discover even for a non-expert. Discover new things to be interested in that don't have a lot written about them.
---
### Keep the Snippets file
- Keep the file of useful code snippets.
- Organize the related snippets into a post.
>>
If you're a programmer or a technical writer - keep the file of useful code snippets. Notice when you're googling the same subject multiple times, or finding yourself copy-pasting similar code over and over again. Organize the related snippets into a post.
---
### Interview people
- Reach out to experienced and successful people.
- Invite them to do an interview.
>>
Find people who are more experienced or successful than you, send them cold emails or tweets, ask if they would like to do an interview and answer some questions.
-
This will be easier to do when your blog/channel/podcast becomes somewhat popular, because then you are offering people to share their ideas with a larger audience, which is more appealing.
-
While your audience is small - you can talk to your peers, bloggers, people you met on social media, anyone on your level who's worth learning from. Normal people often appreciate if you invite them to an interview and ask them questions about their area of expertise.
---
### Industry news
- Summarize the most important things that happened  
in your niche during the last month.
>>
Do a summary of the most important things that happened in your niche during the last week or month. New cool features in your game engine, new cool startups that have been launched, new research papers that have been published.
-
Some good examples - GameFromScratch makes videos about the news in gamedev industry, TwoMinutePapers summarizes the new and exciting AI research papers.
---
### Analysis
- Analyze existing successful products.
>> 
Take an already existing and successful product and explain how it's been made, what makes it successful. Every Frame a Painting makes video essays analyzing movies, Game Maker's Toolkit analyze the mechanics of popular games.
