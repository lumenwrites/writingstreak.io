##### 10 strategies for inventing
# Unlimited <br/> Content Ideas
>>
Hello! In this video I want to share with you my collection of strategies for coming up with an unlimited number of content ideas. You can use them for your youtube videos, blog posts, podcast episodes, articles, and so on.

====
### Project-based ideas
- Work on interesting projects
- Overcome obstacles on your path
- Share your solutions with people
>>
First, there are project-based ideas. You can work on interesting projects, pursue challenging goals, and overcome obstacles that come up on your path. Overcoming interesting challenges inevitably leads to original insights and epiphanies you can share with people.

====
### Teach as you learn
- Study a subject you're interested in
- Share everything you're learning
>>
You can also teach as you learn. You don't have to be an expert to teach - study a subject you're interested in, try to develop a skill, keep notes, and share everything you're learning. If the ideas you're learning are useful to you, they will be useful to other people.
___
Many people even prefer to learn from the beginners, because as a beginner you will find it easier to relate to other beginners. You will be able to notice the most relevant problems and explain things in a more accessible way.

====
### Organize your notes
- Keep notes
- Write down all useful ideas you encounter
- Organize your notes into a post
>>
The next approach is to simply organize your old notes. I keep a file where I write down all the interesting ideas I learn, insightful thoughts that occur to me, anything I want to be able to remember later.
___
This is very helpful, because when I want to write - I don't have to invent anything on the spot, I can just organize my old notes. If I found an idea insightful enough to write down, it is probably worth sharing with people.

====
### Ideas based on reading
- Consume good content
- Write down the most useful takeaways
- Organize them by subject
- Compile them into posts
>>
You want to get used to consuming high quality content - read books, watch video courses, listen to podcasts. Write down the most interesting ideas in your own words, and organize them by subject. Then you can curate the most useful takeaways from multiple sources, and share them.
___
You can also look at the book titles and the chapter titles for inspiration, most of them make for an excellent topic.

====
### Research-based ideas
- Pick a topic you're interested in
- Do research:
  - Wiki articles
  - Blog posts
  - Forum threads
  - Youtube videos
- Compile and summarize the most useful ideas
>>
When you're consuming good content, you're doing it passively, going wherever your curiosity leads you. But you can also pick a topic you're interested in, and deliberately research it - read wiki articles, blog posts, forum threads, and watch youtube videos. Write down the most insightful ideas, summarize them, and share them.
====

### Explain complicated subjects
- Take complicated ideas
- Make them accessible
>>
You can look for ideas that are complex, difficult to understand, or explained in a very dry and boring way. If you go through the work of understanding them, you can make them accessible, concise, engaging, and fun. This will be very valuable to people.
====

### Make connections
- Develop an expertise in different areas
- Apply useful ideas from one field to another
>>
Develop an expertise in different areas that aren't usually connected, and find ways to apply useful ideas from one field to another. This often leads to original insights and interesting inventions. Every time you learn a new idea, ask yourself - how does it apply to the fields I already know, does it solve any problems that I'm aware of?
====

### Copy what already works
- Find popular blogs and youtube channels
- Browse their most popular posts or videos
- Create your own take on these ideas
>>
If you're looking to create popular content, you can just find what already works well, and copy it. Find the most popular blogs, subreddits, and youtube channels in your niche. Browse their most popular posts and videos. Then - see if you can put your own spin on them, add some insights they're missing, or create a better version. Combine several sources on the same subject, extract the most useful patterns, summarize the best ideas, and share them.

====
### Inaccessible Sources
Use the sources not easily accessible to others:
- Expensive online courses
- Real-life courses and live events
- Resources from a different language
>>
Teach what you're learning from the sources not easily accessible to others. You can invest in high quality courses, and then teach what you've learned from them. If you're attending a school, a bootcamp, or a university, you can share what you're learning there.  If you're bilingual - you can share what you've learned from the resources available only in a different language. 
====

### Answer Community Questions
- Find relevant communities
- See the problems people are dealing with
- Answer their questions
>>
Finally, an excellent way to find ideas is to help people in online communities. Go to Discord servers, subreddits, forums in your niche, StackExchange sites, and see what problems people are dealing with, look for frequently asked questions. Answer their questions (using your own expertise or research), and share your answers with your audience. As a side benefit, this will help you to promote your content - you can always write down your	 answer as a blog post or create a video tutorial, and share it as a reply to the question - people will appreciate it.
