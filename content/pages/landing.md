Writing Streak is a tool that will help you to write more. It looks like this:

### Develop your daily writing habit
The best way to become a successful writer is to develop a daily writing habit, and the best way to accomplish that is to take on a 30-Day Writing Challenge - commit to writing every day for the next 30 days.

At the top-left corner of the app you see your Writing Streak:

![](/landing/writing-streak.png)

It counts how many days in a row you successfully wrote enough words to achieve your writing goal. Your purpose is to make this number grow as high as possible by never breaking your streak.

I recommend setting a challenging but attainable goal - write 5 days per week (Monday through Friday), at least 250 words evey day. Strive to do it at the same time every day and get into a routine. The app can automatically send you email reminders when it's time to write, and give you some writing prompts and writing lessons that will help you get started.

Above the editor you see your timeline - a calendar of your last 30 writing days:

Each day shows you how many words you wrote, how close you are to accomplishing your daily goal, and how many minutes you have spent in an uninterrupted flow.

### Focused writing with Writing Sprints
The best way to become a productive writer is to learn how to get into the writing "flow" (a state where 100% of your attention is focused on writing), and stay in that state for uninterrupted stretches of time, with short breaks in-between.

In the top-right corner you see a timer. Set it for 20 minutes, write without interruptions, then take a 10 minute break and repeat.

There are two biggest obstacles that the writers face when they try to enter the flow - overthinking and distractions. To overcome both, and turn the process of writing into a fun game, use the sprints feature:

When you start your timer, your health bar begins to decrease, and the only way to refill it is to keep typing. If you get distracted or stop to think or edit for too long - your health runs out and you lose the sprint. If you manage to keep writing for the whole duration of the sprint without running out of health - you win, and the time gets added to your "focused time" stat for the day.

Strive to gradually increase your focused writing time, remember - you improve what you measure. Start with a 20 minute writing session every morning, once you get used to it - add one more. Keep striving for more daily focused writing sessions as long as it keeps you challenged, but not overwhelmed.

### Accountability
Once you have committed to writing regularly, have set an attainable goal, and have all these powerful tools to help you keep going, the only way to fail is to lose motivation and quit. To prevent that - find someone who will keep you accountable.

On your profile page you see a calendar that displays your writing stats for the whole year:

You can keep your posts private if you want, but the calendar is visible to everybody. I highly recommend that you share the link to your profile with your friends, and ask them to keep you accountable. If they notice that you started missing your writing days - have them give you a call or send you a message. You can even make a bet with your friend, say that you'll give them $50 if they notice that you've missed some days. That will motivate you to keep going.

### Community
Once you're writing regularly, the next step is to increase your writing quality (notice that you should strive to increase quality only **after** you have learned to write regularly and gained some raw skill of just putting words on the page).

The best things you can do to increase your writing quality are:
- Publishing your work, receiving feedback, and improving your writing based on it.
- Giving feedback to others to get better at editing, and to learn from the successes and mistakes of others.

Publish your posts in our friendly and supportive community. Leave thoughtful, constructive, and helpful feedback for others. Remember the principle of reciprocity - the more you help other writers to improve their work, the more likely they will be to help you with yours. When someone left you some good feedback - give back, go to their profile and comment on one of their posts.

<!--
Once you're done writing your post, you can share it with our friendly and supportive community, who will give you advice, feedback, and encouragement.

### Build your audience
Like on Reddit, the posts in our community can get upvoted, and the most popular ones rise to the top. The best posts receive the most attention, discussion, and feedback. Keep publishing to build your reputation and grow your audience!

If you already have a website - you can still write and publish here, your posts here will link to the posts on your website, sending you some traffic and a SEO boost. There's no better way to get your blog posts noticed than sharing them with the community of passionate writers.

Share your work on social media as well. Our editor also has a feature that allows you to export your posts as images. Export your post, and publish it on Twitter:

This will help you to grow your audience on social media, and start gathering a group of dedicated fans who love to read what you have to say.
