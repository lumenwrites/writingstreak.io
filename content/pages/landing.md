<!--
**You know that developing a daily writing habit is one of the most valuable things you can do for your career:**
- Finally finish that book, screenplay, or a course you've been working on.
- Build your reputation, become a well-known expert in your field.
- Grow your audience, build a community around your project.
- Become a better learner, thinker, more productive and creative person.

**But writing regularly is very hard:**
- Writing feels overwhelming, so you procrastinate and never even begin.
- It's difficult to find the time and the motivation to stick to the habit.
- You struggle with the writer's block and not having anything to say.
- Perfectionism and over-editing slow your writing down to a crawl.
- When you finally hit publish it feels like shouting into the void - nobody reads what you wrote or gives you the feedback you need to get better.

**Writing Streak will help you to overcome these obstacles:**

- A **simple but powerful app** will help you to develop a daily writing habit and massively increase your writing output.
- Our **supportive community** will encourage you to write more and help you get better through feedback and advice.

<!-- - A **step-by-step course** will guide you through your first 30 days of writing, and teach you a reliable writing process which will ensure that you'll never run out of ideas and never get stuck in a writer's block. -->

Writing Streak is a tool that will help you to write more. It looks like this:

### Develop your daily writing habit
The best way to become a prolific writer is to develop a daily writing habit, and the best way to accomplish that is to begin and maintain a writing streak:

- Set a specific daily word count goal.
- Keep track of how many days in a row you successfully reach that goal.
- Make this number grow as high as possible by never breaking your streak.
- Keep it up until writing becomes a natural part of your daily life.

At the top-left corner of the app you see your Writing Streak:

![](/landing/writing-streak.png)

Above the editor you see your writing timeline:

![](/landing/writing-day.png)

Each day shows you how many words you wrote, how close you are to accomplishing your daily goal, and how many minutes you have spent in an uninterrupted writing flow.

> I recommend taking on a **30-Day Writing Challenge**:  
> - Commit to writing 5 days per week (Monday through Friday).  
> - At least 250 words every day.  
> - For the next 30 days.  
>
> Strive to write at the same time every day, ideally in the morning - get used to beginning each day with writing!

### Focused writing with Writing Sprints
You will become much more productive if you learn to get into the writing "flow" (a state where 100% of your attention is focused on writing), and stay in that state for uninterrupted stretches of time, with short breaks in-between.

In the top-right corner you see a timer. Set it for 20 minutes, write without interruptions, then take a 10 minute break and repeat.

Writer who tries to enter the flow faces two biggest obstacles: overthinking and distractions. To overcome both, use the Writing Sprints feature:
![](/landing/healthbar.png)

Sprints turn writing into a game:
- When you start the timer, your health bar begins to decrease, and the only way to refill it is to keep typing.
- If you get distracted or stop to think or edit for too long - your health will run out and you will lose the sprint.
- If you manage to keep writing for the whole duration of the sprint without running out of health - you win, and the time gets added to your "focused time" stat for the day.

> Strive to gradually increase your focused writing time. Start with a 20 minute writing session every morning, once you get used to it - add one more.

### Writing much faster with Typewriter mode
The biggest reason why people write slowly and get stuck is that they're trying to edit as they write. A surprisingly simple yet powerful way to grearly increase your output (and reduce the stress) is to clearly divide writing and editing into two separate steps. When you write, your job is to just produce words, imperfect and flawed, the raw material you will turn into quality writing when you edit.

That is why Writing Streak has a Typewriter mode - it disables your backspace and delete keys, and removes your ability to edit during your writing sprint. In addition to that, it has a Blurred mode - which blurs your text making you unable to read it until you're done writing.

Use these features to disable the critic/editor side of your brain, leaving you no other choice but to write.

### Achieve your Writing Goals
Set long-term writing goals with specific deadlines, so that your daily writing adds up to a larger purpose.

- The dotted line represents the ideal word count you should be reaching to achieve your goal on time.
- The solid line represents how many words you actually wrote on any given day.
- To stay on track, you need to make sure that the solid line stays above the dotted line.

> Your first goal is to write 5000 words during the next month:  
250 words per day * 20 workdays = 5000 words.
>
> If you're up for a more ambitious challenge - go to the settings and adjust the numbers accordingly.
>
> But remember, writing a little bit every day, consistently, is more important than aiming for the high daily word counts - succeed at a simple and attainable goal first, take on more difficult challenges later.

### Accountability
Once you have committed to writing regularly, have set an attainable goal, and have learned to write in the flow, the only way to fail is to lose motivation and quit. To prevent that - find someone who will keep you accountable.

On your profile page you see a calendar that displays your writing stats for the whole year:
![](/landing/profile.png)

You can keep your posts private if you want, but the calendar is visible to everybody. I highly recommend that you share the link to your profile with your friends, and ask them to keep you accountable. If they notice that you started missing your writing days - have them give you a call or send you a message.

You can even make a bet with your friend, say that you'll give them $50 if they notice that you've missed some days. That will motivate you to keep going.

Looking for someone to keep you accountable? In [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Mc4HKUsuK9) we have `#writing-buddies` channel - find another writer, and commit to keeping each other accountable and giving each other feedback.

### Community
Once you have successfully developed your writing habit, the next step is to increase your writing quality (notice that you should strive to increase quality only **after** you have learned to write regularly and gained some raw skill of just putting words on the page).

The best things you can do to increase your writing quality are:
- Publishing your work, receiving feedback, and improving your writing based on it.
- Giving feedback to others to get better at editing, and to learn from the successes and mistakes of others.

Publish your posts in our friendly and supportive community. Leave thoughtful, constructive, and helpful feedback for others. Remember the principle of reciprocity - the more you help other writers to improve their work, the more likely they are to help you with yours. When someone left you some good feedback - give back, go to their profile and comment on one of their posts.

<!--
Once you're done writing your post, you can share it with our friendly and supportive community, who will give you advice, feedback, and encouragement.

### Build your audience
Like on Reddit, the posts in our community can get upvoted, and the most popular ones rise to the top. The best posts receive the most attention, discussion, and feedback. Keep publishing to build your reputation and grow your audience!

If you already have a website - you can still write and publish here, your posts here will link to the posts on your website, sending you some traffic and a SEO boost. There's no better way to get your blog posts noticed than sharing them with the community of passionate writers. The best articles are also sent out to the mailing list of our readers, and shared on our social media accounts.

Share your work on social media as well. Our editor also has a feature that allows you to export your posts as images. Export your post, and publish it on Twitter:
![](/landing/tweet.png)

This will help you to grow your audience on social media, and start gathering a group of dedicated fans who love to read what you have to say.
