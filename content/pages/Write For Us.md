## Why write for Nexy
Sharing your knowledge is rewarding in itself, it will help you to flesh out your ideas and clarify your thinking. You can also engage in interesting discussions with our community, receive feedback and advice from intelligent people, and build your reputation.

On top of that, we want to help you spread your ideas and grow your audience:

- The best articles are sent out to our mailing list and shared on our social media accounts.
- Cross-posting is allowed. If you want to publish an article from your own website or a blog - it will have a prominent link (and a canonical url) pointing to the original post, which will send you traffic and help your search engine rankings.
- Calls to action are allowed. High quality articles can contain a CTA at the end, inviting people to check out your product, follow your blog, etc.
- Authors who consistently contribute quality content are allowed to make posts in our "Showcase" hub - you can write a post about your project, explain why it will be interesting to our community, and it will be shared with our readers.

## How to publish your story
To ensure the quality of our content, posting here is invite-only. Write and submit a draft of your post, and it will be published once it has been checked by our editor. After you have successfully published 5 posts, you gain a "trusted" status and can publish posts on your own.
