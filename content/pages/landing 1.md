### Develop your daily writing habit
Writing Streak is a tool that will help you to write more. It looks like this:

![](/landing/full-editor.png)

It's main purpose is to The best way to become a prolific writer is to develop a daily writing habit, and the best way to accomplish that is to begin and maintain a writing streak:

- Decide how many words per day you intend to write.
- Mark every day you succeed at reaching that goal.
- Keep it up until it turns into a natural part of your daily life.

At the top-left corner of the app you see your Writing Streak:

![](/landing/writing-streak.png)

It counts how many days in a row you have successfully achieved your daily word count goal. Your purpose is to make this number grow as high as possible by never breaking your streak.

I recommend taking on a 30-Day Writing Challenge - commit to writing 5 days per week (Monday through Friday), at least 250 words every day, for the next 30 days. Strive to write at the same time every day, ideally in the morning, get into a routine, get used to beginning each day with writing. This is a challenging yet attainable goal, and it is the best thing you can do for yourself as a writer.


### Achieve your Writing Goals
You should also set long-term writing goals (with specific deadlines), so that your daily writing adds up to a larger purpose.

The progress bar around your writing streak represents your progress towards your writing goal. If you click on it, you will see a chart:

![](/landing/burndown.png)

It shows you how many words you need to write per day in order to reach your writing goal before the deadline you have set for yourself. The dotted line represents the ideal word count you should be reaching, the solid line represents how many words you actually wrote in practice. To stay on track, you need to make sure that the solid line stays above the dotted line.

By default, your goal is to write 5000 words during the next month (250 words per day * 20 workdays). If you're up for a more ambitious challenge - go to the settings and adjust the numbers accordingly. But remember, writing a little bit every day, consistently, is more important than aiming for the high daily word counts - succeed at a simple and attainable goal first, take on more difficult challenges later.

### Your writing Timeline
Above the editor you see your timeline - a calendar of your last 30 writing days:

![](/landing/writing-day.png)

Each day shows you how many words you wrote, how close you are to accomplishing your daily goal, and how many minutes you have spent in an uninterrupted writing flow.

### Focused writing with Writing Sprints
The best way to become a more productive writer is to learn how to get into the writing "flow" (a state where 100% of your attention is focused on writing), and stay in that state for uninterrupted stretches of time, with short breaks in-between.

In the top-right corner you see a timer. Set it for 20 minutes, write without interruptions, then take a 10 minute break and repeat.
![](/landing/timer.png)

There are two biggest obstacles that the writers face when they try to enter the flow - overthinking and distractions. To overcome both, and turn the process of writing into a fun game, use the sprints feature:
![](/landing/healthbar.png)

When you start your timer, your health bar begins to decrease, and the only way to refill it is to keep typing. If you get distracted or stop to think or edit for too long - your health runs out and you lose the sprint. If you manage to keep writing for the whole duration of the sprint without running out of health - you win, and the time gets added to your "focused time" stat for the day.

Strive to gradually increase your focused writing time, remember - you improve what you measure. Start with a 20 minute writing session every morning, once you get used to it - add one more. Keep striving for more daily focused writing sessions as long as it keeps you challenged, but not overwhelmed.

### Accountability
Once you have committed to writing regularly, have set an attainable goal, and have learned to write in the flow, the only way to fail is to lose motivation and quit. To prevent that - find someone who will keep you accountable.

On your profile page you see a calendar that displays your writing stats for the whole year:
![](/landing/profile.png)

You can keep your posts private if you want, but the calendar is visible to everybody. I highly recommend that you share the link to your profile with your friends, and ask them to keep you accountable. If they notice that you started missing your writing days - have them give you a call or send you a message.

You can even make a bet with your friend, say that you'll give them $50 if they notice that you've missed some days. That will motivate you to keep going.

### Community
Once you have successfully developed your writing habit, the next step is to increase your writing quality (notice that you should strive to increase quality only **after** you have learned to write regularly and gained some raw skill of just putting words on the page).

The best things you can do to increase your writing quality are:
- Publishing your work, receiving feedback, and improving your writing based on it.
- Giving feedback to others to get better at editing, and to learn from the successes and mistakes of others.

Publish your posts in our friendly and supportive community. Leave thoughtful, constructive, and helpful feedback for others. Remember the principle of reciprocity - the more you help other writers to improve their work, the more likely they are to help you with yours. When someone left you some good feedback - give back, go to their profile and comment on one of their posts.

<!--
Once you're done writing your post, you can share it with our friendly and supportive community, who will give you advice, feedback, and encouragement.
