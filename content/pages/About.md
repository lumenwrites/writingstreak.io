# About
Hi, I'm lumen. Inspired by [Slate Star Codex](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) I'm going to write about things that [gratify my intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html).

I am curious and passionate about startups, technology, science, rationality, webdev, gamedev, digital art, writing (fiction and non-fiction), comedy, creativity, and table-top roleplaying games.

Feel free to shoot me a message for whatever reason, I'm not famous enough to be overwhelmed by emails =)
