Writing Streak is a tool that will help you to write more. It looks like this:

### Develop your daily writing habit
The best way to become a successful writer is to develop a daily writing habit, and the best way to accomplish that is to take on a 30-Day Writing Challenge - commit to writing every day for the next 30 days.

At the top-left corner of the app you see your Writing Streak:

It counts how many days in a row you successfully wrote enough words to achieve your writing goal. Your purpose is to make this number grow as high as possible by never breaking your streak.

I recommend setting a challenging but attainable goal - write 5 days per week (Monday through Friday), at least 250 words. Strive to do it at the same time every day and get into a routine.

Above the editor you see your timeline - a calendar of your last 30 writing days:

Each day shows you how many words you wrote, how close you are to accomplishing your daily goal, and how many minutes you have spent in an uninterrupted flow.

### Focused writing with Writing Sprints
The best way to become more efficient at writing is to be able to get into the writing "flow" (a state where 100% of your attention is focused on writing), and stay in that state for uninterrupted stretches of time, with short breaks in-between.

In the top-right corner you see a timer. Set it for 20 minutes, write without interruptions, then take a 10 minute break and repeat.

There are two biggest obstacles to doing this successfully - overthinking and distractions. To solve both, and turn the process of writing into a fun game, use the sprints feature:

When you start your timer, your health bar begins to decrease, and the only way to refill it is to keep typing. If you get distracted or stop to think or edit for too long - your health runs out and you lose the sprint. If you manage to keep writing for the whole duration of the sprint without running out of health - that time gets added to the focused time stat in your timeline.

### Community and Accountability
Once you're done writing your post, you can share it with our friendly and supportive community, who will give you advice, feedback, and encouragement.

On your profile page you see a calendar that displays your writing stats for the whole year:

You can keep your posts private if you wish, but the calendar is visible to everybody. I highly recommend that you share the link to your profile with your friends, and ask them to keep you accountable. If they notice that you started missing your writing days - have them give you a call or send you a message, this will motivate you to keep writing.

### Build your audience
Like on Reddit, the posts in our community can get upvoted, and the most popular ones rise to the top. The best posts receive the most attention, discussion, and feedback. Keep writing to build your audience!

Our editor also has a feature that allows you to export your posts as images. Export your post, and publish it on Twitter:

This will help you to grow your audience on social media, and start gathering a group of dedicated fans who love to read what you have to say.
