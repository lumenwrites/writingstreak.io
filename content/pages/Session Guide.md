# Session Guide 
## Running Your Own Sessions
The Session Guide is the person who announces and runs the brainstorming session. Their goal is to guide people through the adventure creation process, keep the conversation on track, and do their best to make sure that we will be able to create a complete story within a reasonable amount of time (2-3 hours).

You're welcome to take initiative, announce, and run your own sessions.

<!-- Anyone who has participated in a few sessions and gained some experience with the process is welcome to take initiative, announce, and run their own sessions. -->

## Before The Session Begins

### Make a session announcement
Go to `#session-announcements` and make a post like this:

> 
Hey, @everyone! Who's free to do some brainstorming at [time and date]?
>
We will try to make a short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic adventure set in a fantasy world.
>
We will aim for a 2-3 hour session, give or take. I'm looking for 3-4 people.  
If you can join us - leave a message in this chat.  
>
If you aren't familiar with our process or haven't read the guidelines yet - please read this post before we start our session:
https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room

It's best to limit the group size to 3-4 people. That way everyone has enough time to speak and contribute, things stay more manageable, and the process moves forward faster.

### Create a copy of our templates
Open the [Brainstorming Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0KMVB6qyc_MKvXt2SS4-Zn5seT31QfXjYD1Gb9htzM/) and click `File > Make a Copy`. Do the same with the [One-Page Adventure Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yUqvSokoxJalKhi236xvl4q1cf7EWLVmrfgw9ljGyMI/).

Change the folder from "Resources and Templates" to "Brainstorming Sessions Archive". Don't forget to click `Share` and change "Anyone with the link" to "Editor" (so that everyone with the link can edit the doc).

### Before the session, post a reminder
10 minutes before the session begins, make a post in `#writers-room`:
> 
[@-mention people who signed up]  
We begin in 10 minutes.
>
This is the google doc we’ll be filling in with ideas, open it before we begin:  
[link to the copy of the brainstorming template]  
In the google doc go to Tools > Preferences, and uncheck “Automatically Detect Lists”, otherwise google docs autoformatting will be really annoying.
>
If you haven’t read our guidelines yet - please check them out:

I also recommend to open a note-taking app (can be convenient), and our writing prompts generator (https://perchance.org/adventure-prompts).


## Start Of The Session
- Quick introductions, everyone says a bit about themselves.
- Make sure everyone has the google doc and writing prompts generator open.
- Ask if anyone has any questions about the process before we begin.

## During The Session
- Follow our process, guide people through the brainstorming template step by step.
- Try to keep the conversation on track and do your best to encourage people to follow our guidelines.
- Aim to complete the Brainstorming Template in 1-1.5 hours, and the One-Page Adventure Template in about 40 minutes.

<!-- - If people get stuck or can't pick an idea - call for a vote, roll the dice to pick a random one (`!r 1d10` in chat), or just make the decision yourself and move on. -->
<!-- - If nobody has any ideas - go with the simple/obvious one. Use [writing prompts tool](https://rpgadventures.io/prompts) if necessary. -->


## After The Session
- Dont forget to add everyone's name and discord handle to the list of the authors (at the top of the Brainstorming Template, and at the bottom of the One-Page Adventure Template).
- Invite people for a playtest. Learn how to run playtests [here](/playtesting).
- If we like what we've made, we can clean up the draft of our adventure and share it with others. Use the `#work-in-progress` channel to discuss the adventure after the session. Make a list of things you'd like some help with - remaining open questions you're not sure how to answer, things you would like to improve, ideas to add, issues to fix. Post the link to the adventure draft and the list of questions in `#work-in-progress`, so that other people can help you out.
- Once the adventure is complete, post it in `#finished-adventures`.
- If everyone is cool with it, it would be nice to publish the adventure on our website and share it on reddit to grow the community.
