## What You Will Learn
In this course you'll learn how to make an old school fast paced 3D FPS in the Godot Game Engine.  
  
I'll cover how to set up an environment and lighting, make player movement, create four guns: a machete, shotgun, machine gun, and rocket launcher, make two enemies, one melee and one range, with pathfinding and basic ai, create particle effects for explosions and smoke trails, create animations for weapons, create ammo, health, and weapon pickups, and set up a basic hud for the player.

Scenes and nodes  
GDScript and programming fundamentals.

## Lean by Doing
With me, you jump right into action and within the first hour, you will have your first 3D illustration rendered! Let me show you the image, that one of the students created. One hour lesson is all it took!  
  
I wonâ€™t bore you with lengthy fundamentals sections. You will only learn essential information as you go, and by the end of the course, you will find out that there is no limit on what you can create. At every step, I share my personal workflow tips and every time add a little bit of a secret sauce to the mix :)  
  
Additionally, every chapter has a dedicated downloadable file, so if for some reason you feel like skipping particular chapter, you can continue working right where the next chapter starts.  
  
You get the most out of your time. Video pacing is just right  
fast enough to keep you interested without passing by or assuming any details.  
  
Each video breaks down a specific part of building a Node application and allows for quick referencing in the future. You can binge watch them all today or do a few each day during your lunch or on your commute.
