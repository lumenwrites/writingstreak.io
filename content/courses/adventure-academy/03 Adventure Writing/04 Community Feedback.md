# Community Feedback
Now that you have a solid draft of your adventure, all that's left is to polish it and make some minor improvements.

## Request Feedback
The first step is to go to the communities once again, and ask for their thoughts, constructive criticism, feedback, and help with coming up with more ideas and improvements.

Make a post on [/r/DMAcademy](https://old.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy), [/r/DnDAdventureWriter](https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDAdventureWriter), and our `#writing-help-and-feedback` channel, and ask people to share some feedback and advice.

Here's a post template you can use to increase your chances of receiving quality feedback:
```
Title: I'm working on an adventure about <one-sentence pitch for your adventure>. I could really use some feedback and some help with brainstorming ideas.

**Summary:** 
<A short 2-4 sentence summary of the whole adventure. The problem players will try to solve or goal they'll try to achieve, what makes it difficult.>

You can see the current draft of the adventure here:
<link to the adventure>

**Outline:** 
<Brief descriptions of the main scenes. Key plot points, challenges you'd like your players to face.> 

**Key Characters:** 
<Brief one-sentence descriptions of the Main Antagonist, Quest Giver, and other important NPCs.>

**Key Locations:**
<Brief descriptions of the most important locations the players will visit.>

**Specific Questions:**
<A list of specific questions you'd like some help with. What's confusing you, where do you feel stuck, what kind of feedback are you looking for?>
```

Here's a few examples of my old posts: [1](https://old.reddit.com/r/DndAdventureWriter/comments/i145kt/zeppelin_heist_players_need_to_rescue_a_rebel/), [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/DndAdventureWriter/comments/nefh7s/onepage_adventure_about_prehistoric_tribes/), [3](https://old.reddit.com/r/DndAdventureWriter/comments/nuoil8/im_working_on_a_onepage_adventure_about/), [4](https://old.reddit.com/r/DndAdventureWriter/comments/hhyy75/can_you_help_me_design_a_oneshot_adventure_based/) - they have led to a lot of useful feedback and interesting ideas, and helped me to significantly improve my adventures.

After you've made the posts - engage with the community. You will get way more useful ideas if you talk to people and ask some follow up questions.

## Incorporate Feedback
Read through the replies, find constructive criticism and useful feedback, then make a list of things you would like to improve about your adventure.

As always, add the new ideas to the todo list in your Brainstorming Template, then go through the list and implement the tweaks and improvements one by one.
