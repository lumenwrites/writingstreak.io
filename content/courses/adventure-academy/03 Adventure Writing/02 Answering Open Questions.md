# Answering Open Questions
Now you have a clear summary of everything you know about the story, and a list of specific questions that you still need to figure out.

What you need to do next is go through the questions one by one, and try to figure out the answers. This process mostly involves just thinking, brainstorming and listing possible alternatives, and trying to make the story make sense.

If you're struggling to come up with more creative ideas or fill in the plot holes - use the creative strategies outlined in the course. Use your knowledge of movies/books/games/etc, take ideas from your favorite stories for inspiration, make lists of possible alternatives. Then pick your favorite answer. Try to reverse/exaggerate your ideas, try to make unusual metaphors and associations. Browse inspiring images and Wikipedia articles.

If you're struggling to find an answer to a question - try to make your question as specific as possible. The more precise you get, the more clearly you define and describe your problem, the easier it will be to figure out the answer. Before looking for the answer, try to describe and discuss the problem from all angles, list all the things relevant to the question that you already know.

Don't criticize your answers. Your first goal is to find *any* acceptable answer that makes any sense at all, you can improve upon it later.

Above all - keep things simple and be obvious. At this point you have already created an interesting story with a lot of fun and creative ideas, you don't need all your answers to be mind-blowing. If you can think of the most straightforward, predictable, obvious answer - just use it, it will work perfectly fine.

## Request Community Help
Usually by this point I have managed to figure out the answers to most of the questions, but I'm still having trouble with some of the remaining ones.

Now, the best strategy to use is to talk to other people, more often than not they will help you to find the answers and give you a lot of ideas you didn't think of.

If you have a friend with similar interests - talking to them is a good place to start. If that still doesn't help - it's time to make a post in our `#writing-help-and-feedback` channel, and tap into the power of Reddit's hivemind - make posts in [/r/DMAcademy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dmacademy) and [/r/DndAdventureWriter](https://www.reddit.com/r/DndAdventureWriter) and ask people to help.

When making a post:
- Do your best to define your question as clearly and precisely as possible.
- Explain what you have figured out so far, list the things you have tried, explain why it didn't work.
- Give people a short summary of your adventure, explain everything you do know about the story.
- Keep your post concise, make it as easy as possible for them to give you the answer.

<!--
- Try to predict the obvious unhelpful answers and preempt them.

Following these guidelines will greatly increase your chances of receiving useful feedback.

## Omit and Simplify
After requesting help on Discord and Reddit and following this advice, you're very likely to have most of your problems resolved.

If that still hasn't happened - just omit whatever parts of the story are causing you trouble, and go with the simpler version. It's likely that some of your ideas will come up during the playtest and will be solved with the help of the players. 

You can also always go back to your adventure when you have more experience, and see if you can find an answer then.
