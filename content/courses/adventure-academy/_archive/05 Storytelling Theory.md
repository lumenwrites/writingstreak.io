# Storytelling Theory

Before we begin writing, I want to share with you a few key things you need to know about stories and roleplaying games. <!-- (and how they apply to roleplayng games) -->

## Creating a Place for People to Improvise
Roleplaying is fundamentally a guided improvisation (give or take some boardgamey' mechanics specific to some systems). The GM puts players in exciting situations - cool imaginary places to visit, fun characterst to interact with, interesting challenges to solve, mysteries to uncover.

Players enjoy these situations because they get to exercise their creativity, experience an imaginary world (and make impact on it), and also just socialise and joke around with their buddies.

Why is this interesting? Because creating fun adventures doesn't have to be complicated. You don't have to create Inception level elaborate plots, Breaking Bad level drama, or intricate murder mysteries to make these games fun. The activity is fundamentally fun by itself - people who do improv or play GMless games have enjoyable experience without any pre-planned story at all.

So as an adventure writer, what can you do to improve on that experience?
> Create ideas that are difficult for the GM to improvise on the fly during the game, which help them to put their players in interesting and exciting situations.

What do the GMs need to set up interesting scenarios the players can improvise in?

## Stories are about Problem Solving
Stories and roleplaying games are fundamentally about creative problem solving.

This is the fundamental "game loop" of an RPG - the GM puts an interesting problem in front of the players, and they find creative ways to solve it.

Big problems are broken down into smaller challenges. Every scene the characters try solve a small problem, their successes take them closer to achieving their goal, the setbacks and complications take them farther away from that goal.

Players encounter a big problem at the beginning of the story, they go through a series of challenges that add up to ultimately solving the problem at the climax of the story. 

It gives players the sense of progress, makes them feel like their actions are meaningful, move them closer towards some lar, make impact on the world, and add up to some larger purpose.



That's what gives them fun stuff to do and feels satisfying to accomplish. 








**That's what plot points are** - players solving or failing to solve a problem, which moves them closer to or farther away from the goal. Which feels exciting/valuable/dramatic.
-   Conflict, obstacles, social/exploration/combat encounters are fundamentally just **sources of problems**. There probably are other sources that can generate problems.
-   It's all just nested challenges: Campaign Problem > Adventure Problem > Scene Problem. And any challenge can be used on any of these levels.
-   Therefore, **the list above is a list of adventure ideas and plot points at the same time**. Make any challenge very important/difficult/exciting to accomplish - and it becomes an idea for the adventure or a campaign. Make any adventure idea relatively small and simple - and it becomes a scene challenge (encounter). Put a number of smaller challenges in front of the players - and you've got your basic story structure (a list of encounters, the gameplay). Because goals and challenges are fundamentally the same, just the nested problems, they can be combined in any order to create any number of unique adventures.
-   Also, it means that you can take big story ideas from movies, TV episodes, published modules, and use them as ideas for small encounters. Shawshank Redemption, Alien, Jaws, Incredibles - they can be big campaign ideas, small adventure ideas, or just a thing characters do in a scene (escape from the prison, hide from a monster, defeat a big golem).
-   Game mechanics are also challenges. If there's an RPG system that gets players to do something awesome (GM moves in Dungeon World, Favors/Debts and Social Status mechanics from the Undying, Weak Moves from Dream Askew) - you can use those as challenges too.
-   Even a single challenge can create an unlimited number of unique stories - you just change the concrete details. McGuffins, NPCs, locations, etc.




## Components of an Adventure
Each scene has three main components:
- **Who** - the characters players can interact with.
- **Where** - an interesting location where the scene takes place.
- **What** - challenges for the players to overcome, which gives them something to do in the scene.

If the answers to these questions are entertaining, players will have a good time in the scene.

You want these scenes to add up to a meaningful and satisfying story. Players should feel like they're making progres

For the adventure as a whole to feel meaningful
add up to a satisfying story.

establish a problem, go through the series of challenges
campaigns are tv shows and episodes, series of scenes.
make improv easy
have direction to the story
simulate the world

present people with this

socialise and joke around with their buddies

exercise
collaborative storytelling
interactive

<!-- /Structure -->
Think of long-term campaigns as seasons of a TV show. They are made out of episodes - individual games. Each game is made out of series of scenes.




## Modular Adventure Design

Modular Island  adventure design. you make it interactive by simulating the antagonist and the world, and by using prepared ideas to build improv on top of.
leave room for improv.

Don't overprepare, prepare only what's difficult to improvise on the fly.
