# Course Overview

The goal of this course is to lead you through the process of creating an adventure from start to finish. You will learn the fundamentals of storytelling, follow a step by step adventure brainstorming process to develop your ideas, turn them into an outline and then into a final draft, playtest your adventure and receive feedback, and finally edit and publish it.

### Introduction
In this section you will learn how to get the most out of the course. You will choose your writing tools, establish your goals, learn about the optimal writing process. You'll find the helpful resources and create the documents you'll use to write your adventure. You will also learn the basics of storytelling you need to understand before you dive into the writing process.

### Adventure Brainstorming
This is the core of the course. In this section I will guide you through the process of brainstorming an adventure step by step. You will go from the blank page to a solid plot of an adventure. You will come up with a cool idea, design fun locations and characters, figure out the key plot points and the climax of your adventure. You'll develop all the information you need to successfully write your adventure.

### Adventure Writing
In this section you will actually outline and write your adventure. You will outline your adventure, summarize the ideas developed in the brainstorming section, write the first draft of your adventure, and then improve it to turn it into a complete story you're ready to playtest.

### Playtesting
This part is simple but incredibly valuable. You will playtest your adventure, and during the game you will fill in the blanks and develop a lot more awesome ideas in collaboration with your players. You will receive helpful feedback which will make your adventure even better.

### Publishing
Finally, you will incorporate your experience from the playtest, feedback and new ideas, improve, edit and polish your draft. You'll design the final document for the adventure, learn to publish and market it.
