## Why One-Shot Adventures?
A one-shot adventure is a self-contained story that can be completed in one 3-4 hour game session. Creating a one-shot is the perfect way to learn everything you need to know to create engaging and entertaining stories. 

It is an attainable goal that you can accomplish during the next couple of weeks, and achieving it will give you all the skills you need to take on more ambitious projects, such as longer adventures and campaigns.

## What You will Not Learn in this Course
This course is about storytelling, not stat blocks and mechanics, so you will not find any system-specific instructions on how to create level-appropriate monsters or balance combat encounters. 

You can use this course with any system - DnD, Shadowrun, Fate, or anything else you enjoy playing.  You can use it to make adventures for players of any level. My goal is to help you to create fun and engaging stories. If you want to learn about the mechanics and plug in the numbers - follow the instructions in the rulebook for your preferred system.

I have also done my best to avoid wasting your time with self-help'y motivational speeches, random tangents, rants, and other fluff. I want to deliver all the most valuable and insightful information concisely, so that you could reach your goal as quickly as possible.

## Why should you follow this course?
- **Learn By Doing**  
Learn to make adventures by jumping in and creating an adventure of your own. No more abstract theory than absolutely necessary. Clear and approachable steps that will take you to your goal as quickly as possible.
- **Easy for novice GMs**  
I will show you a simple and straightforward creative process that will help you to write your first adventure even if you've never done it before.
- **No more writer's block**  
No more staring at a blank page in confusion. I mean, writing will still often be challenging, but at least you won't find yourself feeling stuck and not understanding why. You will always have a plan, and a list of clear and attainable goals, specific tasks to accomplish. 
- **Peace of mind**  
Following all the steps and answering all the questions gives you all the information you need to run a well-crafted adventure. You don't have to worry about missing anything important.
- **Clarity and flow**  
The most valuable part of my process is breaking down the adventure writing into a series of small, specific, attainable steps. No task is too complicated or overwhelming, every step has clear instructions. Accomplishing small tasks at the appropriate level of difficulty is how we get into the "flow", the state that makes writing fun and satisfying.
-  **Prep what matters, don't prep what doesn't**  
Spend your energy only on things that actually enhance the game, don't spend hours developing ideas that never get used.
- **High prep or improv-heavy games**  
This process works well for both low-prep improv-focused GMs, as well as for people who prefer more detailed prep. 

<!--

- **Modular design**  
As you follow my process, you will design your adventure in a way that gives you the flexibility to tweak and change the story in response to the players' actions. The adventures you create will not "railroad" players down to one specific path, they will feel interactive, players will feel like they have impact on the world and the outcome of the story. 

You start by creating the key information about your adventure, and improvise the core of the story in a few hours. You can expand  which you can build your improv on top of, and then you
-  You can use this process to improvise an adventure from scratch in a few hours, or you can use it to write a well researched and fleshed-out story over several days or weeks. It can be scaled according to how much time you have and how much do you like to prep or improvise (although I do recommend to keep thigns simple and avoid over-prepping).

specific tasks, questions to answer, creative problems to solve
Once you solve them - you'll have a complete story.
- **Clear, attainable goals**. Always have a concrete, specific task to accomplish. This removes the confusion and ambiguity about what to do next, which is the main cause of the "writer's block".


-   Use it to write your own adventures, or organize your prep of the published modules.



- **Interesting ideas for experienced GMs**. If you are experienced, interesting enough for an experienced GM**.  which can place to get started with

- The main benefits - procedural, modular, SIMPLE. Great for a novice, grows as your skill grows. Based on the fundamentals of storytelling, game design, and improv. 

Don't prepare what you don't need to - you can use this method to create an adventure in two hours (and we have done that before),  you can brainstorm with a friend, or you can spend time writing something longer and detail.

## Who This Course Is For

## FAQ

## About the Author
Hi! I'm Lumen. I have spent the last year writing one-page adventures and learning everything I can about storytelling. Writing used to be very difficult, creativity doesn't come naturally to me, and I constantly struggled with the writers' block. But I have ended up designing a process that works really well for me and for other people, making all the steps straightforward and clear. Me and my friends have used this process to create and run a bunch of one-shot adventures, and they turned out to be really fun.
