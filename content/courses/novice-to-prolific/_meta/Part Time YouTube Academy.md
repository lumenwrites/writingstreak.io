## Choosing your niche.
### Why niches are important
Sell one thing and sell it well.
The more niche you become, the easier it is to stand out.
You don't want to compete to be the best in your category, you want to be the only one in your category.

### Architect vs Archeologist, No Perfect Niche, Follow the data
Architect - plan out everything.
Archaeologist - discover everything as you go.
Should be archeologist. Discover as you go.
Do the work and your niche will emerge over time.

It's a lot easier to change directions if you're moving than if you're stationary.
You can't steer a car that isn't moving.
You don't need the perfect niche right now, there's no such thing as perfect niche.
It emerges for you over time, and most likely it'll be hyper specific to you and your interests.
Make a list of different niches you're interested in, ideally in the same general area.
You look at the data and choose what works best.
Market will tell you what people need.
And you will learn what you enjoy writing about.
You can literally ask your audience what they want.
They will ask you questions.

### Do I absolutely have to niche?
No, as long as you're okay with slowing down your growth and making the path to success harder. Which can be okay.

As an artist, I understand the desire to do whatever you want. 
What if you REALLY hate the idea of just one niche - then don't, maybe it's going to hamper your growth but if it'll make you a happier person - fuck it. Money and subscribers isn't the only thing you're optimizing for. Do you really care about getting as big as possible? Or do you care about creating the content you're passionate about and enjoying the journey? Scott Alexander writes about whatever he damn well pleases - psychology, science, politics, rationality, etc - and he's incredibly successful.
- My single goal is to blow up asap and I'll do whatever it takes to optimize for that
  - Target a niche
  - Competitor analysis
  - Hire immediately
- I don't really care about growing a huge following, I'd rather take it at my own pace, make content I care about, and enjoy the journey.
  Make content you enjoy. Have fun. journey before destination.
- Start by targeting a niche and expand. Start with a small niche grow over time.  
Action steps - create a solid twitter bio.

### Who am I and what do I want?
- What am I good at? What do others ask me for help with/questions?
- What am I passionate about? What do I enjoy?
- List things you're interested in.
- What industries/audiences/groups am I familiar with or a part of?
- What do I wish I had known 3/5/10 years ago that I could help people with now?
- How can I combine some of the points above to make a niche? Topic + People = Niche.
- What does my dream youtube channel/blog look like?
- What makes me excited about writing?
- What benefits does my channel/writing have for someone else? Does it solve a problem for them? Does it entertain them? 

### Your Perfect Reader
Customer avatar.

### Who is my audience and what do they want?
- Who is your ideal viewer/reader?
  The person who'll be your biggest fan, who will tell all their friends about you, and sing you praises from the rooftops.
  What's their story? What's their personality like? What do they value? How do they spend their time? What problems are they facing? What future does that person want?
- Who are they? What do they want? Why can't they get what they want? What problems/obstacles they're facing? What are the stakes if they don't get what they want? What transformations will they experience if they finally get what they want? What keeps them up at night? What are they afraid of? What are they angry about?  Who are they angry at?
- What are their top 3 daily frustrations?
- What do they believe about the world?

Pick yourself but 5 years younger.
Me but 5 years younger and a bit more incompetent.

Your ideal reader avatar.

### What VALUE am I giving to my TARGET AUDIENCE?
Your value proposition.
What you do + why you do it.
What do you write about, and what will the audience get from it.
Why your target audience should care about your videos.
- What value do you want readers to get from your writing?
- Why should they care about your writing?
- What about your writing will going to keep them coming back?
Try to make it short and well defined.
Be arrogant and narcissistic, no points for humility.
Really figure out why shold anyone bother reading your stuff.
Be more specific.
Good: public speaking for non-native english speaker
Bad: i help people improve their lives or i help people make money

It's like a compass, you roughly move in that direction and gradually correct the course and refine it. It does NOT have to be perfect.

### More
+ Make it stick.

### Imposter Syndrome + Credibility + Authority
You don't have to be an expert you can be a guide rather than a guru.
This is something I'm still struggling with, this is what I have learned.

## Idea Generation Machine
Guarantee that you'll never ever run out of content ideas.
Capture + Generate
### Capture
Eureka Moments - write down the random ideas. 
Birdsong Technique - as soon as you become a creator, everything you see becomes an idea. Put it in the information capture system. Kindle/instapaper > readwise > notion. Any post + comments. Top tweets.
nothing is original, nothing comes from nowhere, people just don't know the references. "Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again." Stop trying to make something out of nothing. Make videos other people have already made, it actually benefits you, it has already been proven to work. Don't worry about being original.
Coal Mining - Actively finding sources you can mine for ideas when you need them.
Collect lists of great blogs, subreddits, twitter accounts.

Source chain. Original book, blog summary, tweet thread summary, video summary of the thweet thread. For more original ideas go up the source chain. More derivative sources are easier to package but are less original.
### Generate
5 Months in 5 minutes.
List 5-10 topics you want to learn.
List 5-10 topics you want to / can teach. 
The more similar your lists are, the more you have creator-audience fit.
Expand each topic into a list of steps. Each step is a post/video idea. Substeps for outline.
> How to start a newsletter
	- Finding the platform
		- Substack
		- Revue
		- ConvertKit
		- Mailchimp
	- What to talk about
	- How to grow
		- Valuable content
		- Referral schemes
		- Guest posting
	- How to get people to sign up
	- Format of the newsletter

If you run out of things you can teach - you can just learn new things.

Ask the Audience - ask on twitter or mailing list or my discord. anything you'd like to learn about x? Ask on reddit (my post example).

You can basically repeat a video every 3-6 months and noone will notice.
You can just repeat videos that work well.

Keyword Analysis
Youtube video analytics.
Youtube search + suggestions.
TubeBuddy + VidIQ
Youtube creator > Audience > Other videos your audience watched
Channels blow up because of suggested videos.

> Obviously copy writing ideas from youtube channels.

# Make videos people want to watch.
get them to click, keep them watching. There's no more secret to it.

## Click
Title + Thumbnail
Stop thinking in terms of articles/videos, start thinking in terms of titles.
That's the very first thought because that's the only thing that will determine whether anyone will actually look at what you wrote.
At onion they start with titles.
Don't even start writing until you have a decent title.
Generate 20 titles (in 10 minutes). Highest ROI.
It's only clickbait if promise isn't delivered.
Creating intrigue in the title.

90% of views are coming from browse and suggested videos, not search.
Browse-oriented videos are clickbaity, they grab your attention and appeal to emotion.
Search-oriented is super niche and specific, answers a specific question for the viewer.
Channels don't blow up because of search they blow up because of browse
(also applies to social media, people browse HN/Reddit/Twitter)

Good title:
- Sell the result. How I type really fast. How I remember everything I read.
Not "how I take notes from books", ask why would they want that, the benefit. We take notes to remember things. Ask "Why?" The problem to be solved, the job to be done.
"Spotlight effect" > How I beat impostor syndrome. How I became a better speaker.
Not process but the result. "Understand the spotlight effect" is not something people want to do. Sell the result not the process.
- Intrigue vs agreement. Put a question in the mind of the viewer as opposed to putting agreement in the mind of the viewer.
"Why having fun leads to more productivity" - oh, yeah, that makes sense. (unless it's counterintuitive)
"I WAS WRONG - the real secret to productivity"
"How writing online made me a millionaire". Curiosity - Open a question, hide key information.
It doesn't matter if title is super relevant, as long as people don't feel missold. As long as its somewhat related, it's fine. A lot of artistic license.
- Don't describe. Not "10 tips for being more productive". More intrigue - "How I 100xd my productivity". "How to 100x your productivity".
- Optimize for humans, not SEO. Algorithm follows preferences of people. Who is the sort of person I want to click on this video, who will enjoy this post.
- "How I" works better than "How to". Also creates guide rather than guru vibe. "How I became a millionaire" or "8 habits that will make you a millionaire".
Exercise:
- Take one of your old posts (or one of the ideas generated in the previous section) and brainstorm 10 titles following this principle.

Thumbnail
the youtube face shows good analytics because youtube audience is young and it shows what kids click on. if you're aiming for a more sophisticated audience, that's not the vibe you want to create. we want to go a bit more aesthetic/classy.
vibe can be a very aesthetic instagram feed.
what would this look like on instagram feed.
also because everyoen is doing the weird face.
title shouldn't be the same as text in thumbnail.
emotion is good if it fits the vibe.
Balance art and analytics.

tube buddy for ab testing.

Exercise:
- Craft an intriguing hook for your article (do more research on how to do this well).

Assignment:
- Steal like an artist, write a post based on one of the ideas you've generated based on one of your coalmines.

## Keep them Watching
Hook. First 10 seconds. Reduce the dropoff. 
In yt you want people to keep watching, in text you want them to get to your cta.
It's gonna sound weird, I taped my mouth for 30 days, and I'm gonna explain why (cut away to something else).
$100 to invest in your youtube studio.
How we manage our time is the key to figuring out how to produce at a high level. And if there's one change I've made in my life it's incorporating something called "batching".

## Craft Good/Engaging video
Title - make a promise
