# Playtest
Finally you have everything you need to playtest your adventure!

The purpose of a playtest is to practice running your adventure before you run it for your players, or to receive some feedback before publishing it.

Your goal is to play out a fun story, see the adventure from the perspective of the players, notice any existing issues and open questions, come up with more cool ideas, and to practice running the adventure before we do it for our players.

Remember - there's no pressure to make your adventure perfect before you run it - if you're unsure of your GMing skills, or worried that there may be some gaps in your story - playtesting is the perfect way to practice running your story and find all the improvements you can make. Assume that the players will understand and help you out!

## Announce the Game
Go to our `#playtest-announcements` channel and invite people to your game. Make a post using the following template:

```
**Adventure Title:** <Into the Dark Wizard's Tower!>
**Game System:** <Freeform Roleplaying>
**Date & Time:** <3 hours from now, at 4PM GMT>
**Spots Taken:** 0/4

**Description:**
<Describe the type of adventure you are looking to run, short summary of your adventure, and what kind of feedback you're looking for.>
```

If you're struggling to find enough players, make a post on [/r/lfg](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/) and invite people from there to participate as well.

Example post:

**Post body:**  
Hi! I'm working on a new adventure, and today I want to playtest it for the first time. It will be a freeform, improv/storytelling/roleplay focused game. It might end up being a disaster, but it might also be very fun =)

If that sounds like fun - [learn how to play](https://rpgadventures.io/playtesting) (the rules are very short and simple), create your character, and send me a message! I'm `yourusername#7925` on Discord.

When the people message you - invite them to our server (the invite link: `https://discord.gg/JZmXfWD85D`) and run your game in the Playtesting channels.

## Game System
You can use your favorite system to playtest the game, or you can use the [ruleset](https://rpgadventures.io/mirage) I have designed specifically for playtests - it is focused on freeform, improv-heavy, combat-light, roleplay-focused games. It doesn't have any of the intricate rules and mechanics that will slow down your game without resulting in any useful feedback, it will help you to focus on storytelling, improvisation, and fleshing out your story.

## Preparing for the Game
You already wrote your adventure and know your story, so you have everything you need to play.

Before the game, run through the adventure in your mind, play through the game in your imagination. I like to go for a walk, and as I walk I picture myself running the game for my players, and I write down the notes and ideas that come to mind. 

Knowing that I'm about to run a game in a couple of hours does wonders to help me focus and come up with a bunch more last-minute ideas and improvements.

Right before you're about to start the game, open your adventure draft, and the folder with the illustrations you have collected (if you want to share them with your players).

## During the Game
Relax and just play. Don't take it seriously and don't try too hard. You've already created the story, you have the adventure open in front of you for backup, now you can just let the improv take you wherever it does.

Hold your ideas lightly - don't try to stick to the story too rigidly, don't try to force the outcomes you have planned. Let the players steer the story in unexpected directions, "yes and" them, build on top of their ideas - it's all a part of the game, it will lead to new and brilliant ideas, and will only enhance your adventure.

If you notice any mistakes or plot holes in your story - improvise, fill the gaps as you play.

If you notice that something is missing, something you wish you had prepared in advance - take a note.

If you or one of the players comes up with an interesting and unexpected idea - take a note as well, you will add it to your adventure later.

If the players don't mind - ask them if you can record the audio of your playtest, it can be helpful to listen to if you forget how some parts of the adventure went.

## After the Game
Ask the players for some feedback:
- Did you enjoy the adventure?
- Did you notice any issues with the story, was anything confusing?
- Was the pacing good? Were there any times when you felt bored?
- Was the resolution of the story fun and satisfying?
- Is there anything I could've done better?
- Do you have any thoughts or ideas on how I could improve the adventure?

Since the players in our community are often adventure writers themselves, they are likely to volunteer some useful feedback and helpful ideas.

Now, all that's left is to incorporate that feedback (and the notes you took during the game) into your story, to make your adventure even better for future players. 

If you want to run the playtest multiple times - feel free to do that, every time you run the game you'll get better and more confident, you'll often find unexpected paths the players may take through the adventure, and come up with more cool ideas and descriptions. Also, more people will get to experience your story.
