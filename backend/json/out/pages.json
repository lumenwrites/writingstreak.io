It is inspired by Reddit, Hacker News, Indie Hackers, Less Wrong, Medium, and Dev.to.\n\nI want Nexy to become a community of makers - startup founders, indie hackers, developers, designers, writers. I want it to become a place where smart and creative people share their knowledge, get to know each other, exchange feedback and advice, help each other to get better at their craft, and showcase their projects.\n\nFor now this is still a very early beta, used mostly by myself ([lumen](/lumen)). Inspired by Scott Alexander and Paul Graham, I'm going to write about things that I'm curious and passionate about - startups, technology, webdev, gamedev, rationality, creativity, and writing. I will write about things that [gratify my intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html), and try to create articles that smart and creative people would find interesting.\n\nIf this works, I hope to grow this project into a really cool community and a helpful resource.\n\nFor now, posting here is invite-only. If you want to participate in this project and have a post you think will be interesting to our community - send the link to lumenwrites@gmail.com\n\nAlso feel free to reach out to me in Discord (`lumen#7925`) or Twitter([@lumenwrites](https://twitter.com/lumenwrites)) for any reason.\n"},{"title":"About","slug":"about","url":"/post/about","tags":[],"description":"","thumbnail":null,"social":null,"comments":null,"relatedPosts":null,"body":"# About\nHi, I'm lumen.
