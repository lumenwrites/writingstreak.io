Your purpose is to make this number grow as high as possible by never breaking your streak.</p>\n<p>I recommend setting a challenging but attainable goal - write 5 days per week (Monday through Friday), at least 250 words evey day. Strive to do it at the same time every day and get into a routine. The app can automatically send you email reminders when it's time to write, and give you some writing prompts and writing lessons that will help you get started.</p>\n<p>Above the editor you see your timeline - a calendar of your last 30 writing days:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/landing/writing-day.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Each day shows you how many words you wrote, how close you are to accomplishing your daily goal, and how many minutes you have spent in an uninterrupted flow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-content-focused-writing-with-writing-sprints\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#focused-writing-with-writing-sprints\"><span></span></a>Focused writing with Writing Sprints</h3>\n<p>The best way to become a productive writer is to learn how to get into the writing \"flow\" (a state where 100% of your attention is focused on writing), and stay in that state for uninterrupted stretches of time, with short breaks in-between.</p>\n<p>In the top-right corner you see a timer. Set it for 20 minutes, write without interruptions, then take a 10 minute break and repeat.\n<img src=\"/landing/timer.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There are two biggest obstacles that the writers face when they try to enter the flow - overthinking and distractions. To overcome both, and turn the process of writing into a fun game, use the sprints feature:\n<img src=\"/landing/healthbar.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When you start your timer, your health bar begins to decrease, and the only way to refill it is to keep typing. If you get distracted or stop to think or edit for too long - your health runs out and you lose the sprint. If you manage to keep writing for the whole duration of the sprint without running out of health - you win, and the time gets added to your \"focused time\" stat for the day.</p>\n<p>Strive to gradually increase your focused writing time, remember - you improve what you measure.

If they notice that you started missing your writing days - have them give you a call or send you a message.
