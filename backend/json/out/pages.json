We emphasize curiosity, truth-seeking, critical self-reflection, intellectual collaboration, and the long attention spans required to actually think through complicated ideas.\nWe are open to unusual ideas and are willing to doubt conventional wisdom. Curiosity and truth-seeking require a willingness to sometimes consider positions which are strange by ordinary standards, and in some cases, these positions will turn out to be credible. As a result of this openness, some unconventional ideas are prevalent on LessWrong and many more are entertained.\nWe make intellectual progress by building on a large number of communally-shared background ideas and concepts.\n\nhttps://www.indiehackers.com/contribute\nhttps://medium.com/about\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html\nhttps://dev.to/about\nhttps://dev.to/page/faq\nhttps://habr.com/en/sandbox/start/\n\npublish as a brand\nhttps://sponsor.hackernoon.com/?ref=hackernoon.com#brandasauthor\n -->"},{"title":"About","slug":"about","url":"/post/about","tags":[],"description":"","thumbnail":null,"social":null,"comments":null,"relatedPosts":null,"body":"# About\nHi, I'm lumen.
