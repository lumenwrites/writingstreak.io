It looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/landing/full-editor.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Its main purpose is to help you to begin and maintain your writing streak. At the top-left corner you see your <strong>writing streak counter</strong> - it shows you how many days in a row you have successfully achieved your daily word count goal:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/landing/writing-streak.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Your objective is to make this number grow as high as possible by never breaking your streak.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I recommend taking on a <strong>30-Day Writing Challenge</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Commit to writing 5 days per week (Monday through Friday).</li>\n<li>At least 250 words every day.</li>\n<li>For the next 30 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strive to write at the same time every day, ideally in the morning - get used to beginning each day with writing!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Above the editor you see your writing timeline:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/landing/writing-day.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Each day shows you how many words you wrote, how close you are to accomplishing your daily goal, and how many minutes you have spent in an uninterrupted writing flow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"focused-writing-with-writing-sprints\">Focused writing with Writing Sprints</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Writing flow is a state where 100% of your attention is focused on writing. You will become much more productive if you learn to stay the flow for multiple uninterrupted stretches of time, with short breaks in-between.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the top-right corner you see a timer. Set it for 20 minutes, write without interruptions, then take a 10 minute break and repeat.\n<img src=\"/landing/timer.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There are two biggest obstacles that the writers face when they try to enter the flow - overthinking and distractions. To overcome both, use the Writing Sprints feature:\n<img src=\"/landing/healthbar.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Sprints turn writing into a game:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you start the timer, your health bar begins to decrease, and the only way to refill it is to keep typing.</li>\n<li>If you get distracted or stop to think or edit for too long - your health will run out and you will lose the sprint.</li>\n<li>If you manage to keep writing for the whole duration of the sprint without running out of health - you win, and the time gets added to your \"focused time\" stat for the day.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strive to gradually increase your focused writing time. Start with a 20 minute writing session every morning, once you get used to it - add one more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"achieve-your-writing-goals\">Achieve your Writing Goals</h3>\n<p>Set long-term writing goals (with specific deadlines), so that your daily writing adds up to a larger purpose. The progress bar around your writing streak counter represents your progress towards your writing goal. If you click on it, you will see a chart:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/landing/burndown.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The dotted line represents the ideal word count you should be reaching to achieve your goal on time.</li>\n<li>The solid line represents how many words you actually wrote on any given day.</li>\n<li>To stay on track, you need to make sure that the solid line stays above the dotted line.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your goal is to write 5000 words during the next month:<br>\n250 words per day * 20 workdays.</p>\n<p>If you're up for a more ambitious challenge - go to the settings and adjust the numbers accordingly.</p>\n<p>But remember, writing a little bit every day, consistently, is more important than aiming for the high daily word counts - succeed at a simple and attainable goal first, take on more difficult challenges later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"accountability\">Accountability</h3>\n<p>Once you have committed to writing regularly, have set an attainable goal, and have learned to write in the flow, the only way to fail is to lose motivation and quit. To prevent that - find someone who will keep you accountable.</p>\n<p>On your profile page you see a calendar that displays your writing stats for the whole year:\n<img src=\"/landing/profile.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You can keep your posts private if you want, but the calendar is visible to everybody. I highly recommend that you share the link to your profile with your friends, and ask them to keep you accountable. If they notice that you started missing your writing days - have them give you a call or send you a message.</p>\n<p>You can even make a bet with your friend, say that you'll give them $50 if they notice that you've missed some days. That will motivate you to keep going.</p>\n<h3 id=\"community\">Community</h3>\n<p>Once you have successfully developed your writing habit, the next step is to increase your writing quality (notice that you should strive to increase quality only <strong>after</strong> you have learned to write regularly and gained some raw skill of just putting words on the page).</p>\n<p>The best things you can do to increase your writing quality are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publishing your work, receiving feedback, and improving your writing based on it.</li>\n<li>Giving feedback to others to get better at editing, and to learn from the successes and mistakes of others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Publish your posts in our friendly and supportive community. Leave thoughtful, constructive, and helpful feedback for others. Remember the principle of reciprocity - the more you help other writers to improve their work, the more likely they are to help you with yours. When someone left you some good feedback - give back, go to their profile and comment on one of their posts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"build-your-audience\">Build your audience</h3>\n<p>Like on Reddit, the posts in our community can get upvoted, and the most popular ones rise to the top. The best posts receive the most attention, discussion, and feedback. Keep publishing to build your reputation and grow your audience!</p>\n<p>If you already have a website - you can still write and publish here, your posts here will link to the posts on your website, sending you some traffic and a SEO boost. There's no better way to get your blog posts noticed than sharing them with the community of passionate writers.</p>\n<p>Share your work on social media as well.
